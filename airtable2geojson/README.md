> Export airtable tables to json/geojson in Github

We created this so that we could manage data for an online map in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/). It will export one or more tables in Airtable to an object of [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) files on Github. It parses each table for either a text field named `geometry`, which should be a stringified valid [GeoJSON geometry](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1), or two number fields named `lon` and `lat` which should be valid longitude and latitude in WGS84. The exported file will be of the format:

```
{
  <table_name>: {...} // GeoJSON FeatureCollection
}
```

## Usage

The script depends on several environment variables which you can set a `.env` file if you run this locally:

```
TABLES=Table 1, Table 2
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxxx
GITHUB_REPO=github_repo_name
GITHUB_OWNER=github_repo_owner_name
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=airtable_api_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=airtable_base_id
GITHUB_BRANCH=github_branch_for_export
GITHUB_FILENAME=filename_for_github_export
```

Run the export with `node airtable-export.js`

We run this as a scheduled task on Heroku, and you can do the same by using the deploy button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Once the app is deployed visit the 'Resources' page for your app on the Heroku dashboard, make sure the dynos are turned off, and configure the scheduler to run the export command `node airtable-export.js` at the schedule of your preference.
