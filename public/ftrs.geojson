        "description": "The design is an homage to dancer. In our current world, where most people work at highly sedentary jobs, it is important to promote movement and an active lifestyle. Dance is not only exercise, but expressive, non competitive, and joyful. All cultures have some form of dance, which brings people together and allows for joy and expression. Contemporary dance is the result of a lot of work done by pioneering women, and especially queer people, and people of colour, which deserves to be honoured. These groups of people are all cultural producers in Toronto who still struggle for space and recognition within the art world."

Inspired by 80s design and dance culture, Art Deco and Pop Art, and contemporary architecture, it plays on motifs seen along Queen street, at underground zine fairs like Canzine and the Toronto Art Book Fair, and at galleries throughout the city. It is a remix of the fun elements and cutting-edge aesthetics that make up contemporary Toronto’s street scenes. The bold geometric shapes hint at the surrounding architecture, while the frenetic patterns emphasize the people and energy of the people in the streets."
