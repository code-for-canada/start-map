        "artist_bio": "Sean Martindale is an internationally recognized, award winning interdisciplinary artist and designer based in Toronto, Canada. His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

I work exclusively with black and white images sing a combination of comic book illustration, graffiti street art and abstract images. Thematically my artworks explore the interrelationships between man, nature and technology primarily from an urban perspective. The goal of my work is express a positive optimistic warning towards progress and society. My work is playful yet insightful in order to appeal to audiences of all ages. I focus on live painting performances and street art because I believe public artworks have the most impact an offer the best opportunity to initiate dialogue. I worked as a fully licensed street artist from 2005-2009 where I created live murals at various locations across Toronto. Since that time I have become a full time muralist working across Canada and internationally. Notable clients include Hudson’s Bay Co., Scotiabank, Converse, Dr. Martens, Waterloo University, UofT, Thyssenkrupp Canada, A.G.O. StreetARTToronto.",

        "artist_bio": "Visual Artist\n\nChristiano De Araujo is a self-taught artist who was born in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. His earliest memory as a child is the moment when he discovered his love of art. As a toddler, he remembers picking up a crayon that his older sister had left behind. When she found that Christiano had taken it, she grabbed it away from him, but in that short amount of time, he had fallen in love with colours and the ability to create.\n\nHis love of art and his talent for the drawing were evident when he was a student in school. His first passion was comics and cartoons and at age 12 he drew his first comic strip.\n\nIn his late teens, Christiano began working for Brazil’s highly circulated newspaper, Diário da Manhã, doing editorial cartoons and illustrations. He also continued to work for other local newspapers and magazines. Realizing that he wanted more opportunities than he could have in Brazil, Christiano chose to immigrate to Canada.\n\nHis first years in Canada were a struggle. Early on, he landed a job as a Bricklayer, which he did for a number of years. Christiano confronted his weaknesses and discovered his strengths, learned to laugh at his hardships, quickly moving on. He was able to overcome any adversities with a determination to succeed and a desire to make himself a better man. This led to his artwork being published in numerous magazines and newspapers in Toronto.\n\nHe also credits his success to a spiritual awakening that he had through meditation and self-hypnosis. It gave him clarity and focus. This experience gave him more confidence and the ability to control his emotions and himself. Christiano devotes much of his life to his art. His endeavours include drawing, oil and acrylic painting, airbrushing, cartooning and sculpting. He is an artist by trade, finds art fun and likes to explore new media and innovated techniques.\n\nChristiano currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He is the founder of Toronto Artists Studio, a studio of visual artists, painters, digital artists and sculptors who design and produce murals and visual communication projects for audiences on a small and grand scale.\n\nAt the present moment, this very moment… Christiano is enjoying the wonderful interaction between the mind and the universe. This infinite universe in which we are all one!",

        "artist_bio": "Amir Akbari is a Greater Toronto Area (GTA) based Visual Artist, Educator, Community Advocate and Entrepreneur.   In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

        "artist_bio": "Sean Martindale is an internationally recognized, award winning interdisciplinary artist and designer based in Toronto, Canada. His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

With his continued artistic development, illustration became his\ndeepest passion and talent. His desire to learn and absorb from his surroundings led him on a\npersonal creative journey. As a graduate of the Graphic Design program at Humber College\nwith over 10 years of working experience behind him, Adrian has established his place in\nToronto’s modern art community. His style is provocative and inspiring and defies\ncategorization. Blurring the lines between graffiti and ultra realism, Adrian’s voice and vision is\ninstantly identifiable. His works include countless portraits and illustrations for various\nmagazines and collaborations with the City of Toronto to develop murals for vacant community\nspaces. In the past Adrian has painted complete buildings and city blocks, designed award\nwinning video games and animated television shows. He has also successfully developed and\nfiled a functioning patent for the Stud Horse Foldable Drawing Bench and is the Principal and\nFounder of Behind the Front Visual Arts Studio.",

I believe in the values of the StART programs and have experienced the dedication of the team to carrying out these values through supporting and partnering.\n\nI am a visual artist passionate about arts engagement and education, collaborative art making, and murals. These practices bridge my background from a Bachelor of Fine Art in Drawing & Painting from OCAD University and a Community Arts Practice Certificate from York University. Since 2011, I have worn many ‘hats’ in the mural, art and community arts field; from artist, arts educator, facilitator, curator, arts administrator and project manager. I have had the opportunity to work and learn from these experiences, building adaptability and flexibility through working in unique situations including libraries, schools, art galleries, community centres, seniors centres, skate parks, abandoned storefronts (you name it!). I have built a strong rapport working with many artists and arts organizations such as Mural Routes, Vibe Arts, Nuit Blanche, Lakeshore Arts, Platform A, Scribble me Silly, Arts Etobicoke and East End Arts. In particular, I have worked closely with Mural Routes since 2011, as Program Coordinator, Facilitator, Curriculum Coordinator, and Program Director, with a focus on mentorship and the Mural Art Learning Institute programs.\n\nMy creative processes for involving community and youth in projects within their own neighbourhoods are based in facilitation style that creatively employs storytelling, brainstorming, and playful art techniques like collage to encourage conversations, confidence and to bring many ideas together into action. It gives me great joy to facilitate consultation, design, art making and mural making to bring community members together to reflect and re-imagine their neighbourhood. I love any opportunity to nurture participants’ creative abilities and create a safe space for exploration and connection through visual arts and storytelling. I see art as a tool for exploring themes, beginning conversation, gathering patterns and beginning important dialogue. Mural consultation and participation offers a space where artists and community members alike can share, exchange, grow and work together.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

        "artist_bio": "I would like to continue working with StART because they support the creation of art that makes our public realm a more beautiful and inviting place. StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

        "artist_bio": "MEDIAH has proved that he can execute a mural project of this scale as he has worked with the Street Art Toronto staff for over the past five years to execute 5 large-scale, landmark art murals around the City (RADI’AAL ENCOMPASS mural on the Woodbine/Gerrard bridge underpass, TERRA STRAT’AA bridge on the Leslie/Eglinton Ave underpass, Leslieville Bike Share mural, LANTERN SHELL murals on O’Connor Drive, and the wrapped DRIFT APPENDAR mural for Westbury National on Warden Ave, in Scarborough). In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

However, recently I've been getting more into creating murals for commercials spaces (with spray paint and house paint) and would really love to participate and learn more from StrART projects and how the organization beautifies the city. Generally, my work is influenced by how colours and how they shape a subject can express universal stories or emotions especially applying them on portraits to elaborate on the subject's nuanced story/mood. Since my work is essentially influenced by formless colours and emotions, my process basically involves trying to form or incorporate these colours/shapes into the subject I'm reinterpreting into my style. My overall goal for getting involved with StART is to essentially learn and challenge myself in new ways to express that colourful vision.",

His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

I feel the more mediums , styles and tools create more infinite forms and and ever lasting growing process.\n\nThrough these practices, he has established a signature style of his own called, 'Ancient Graffuturism'.\nIn this he combines elements of abstract art,Manga,international Architecture, Calligraphy, Graffiti & Ancient Filipino Design Inspired Images & Symbols.\nBeing a Diaspora, Rowell likes to blend his asian heritage into his work to feel more connected with himself.\n\n\nI want to work with StART because I Share a common Thread with the organization which is to create and protect communities and businesses. I do this for a living so If I can join forces with the organization we could become more of a powerful positive force and spread love through mural art. I would like to learn from StART anything that comes with mural making, Mural planning, community engagement, outreach. I know a little bit about each element but there will always be more to learn. I am good at working with people. I have colloborated many times in the city and internationally on Murals. I am open to learning and working with new people in StART .

His work explores the juxtaposition of nature with human constructs through explorations into challenging humanities anthropocentric views towards ourselves and our environment. He merges historical approaches to realist and modern art to explore the nature vs culture divide through figures that examine various overlapping themes of anthropocenterism using natural and man made elements and materials.\nTed's work has exhibited in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Steamwhistle Gallery, the RMG, The Station Gallery, Nathan Phillips Square, Bluffs Gallery, the Super Wonder Gallery and his Sculptural Mural Installation is the centerpiece installation of the Aurora Cultural Centre in Aurora Ontario.\n\nIn paint I work with Aerosol and acrylic and Latex. In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

With StART’s support I want to be mentored in my mural career with any opportunities to connect with seasoned mural/street artists and get on a swing-stage, aerial lift, use a spray gun, while learning to comprehend XL large walls and huge quantities of paint among advanced techniques of execution and project production. I’ve currently reached the stage of painting garages in Toronto and am interested and ready to go larger.\n\nBio & Artist Statement\nAnya Mielniczek is a Toronto based multidisciplinary artist who combines her fine art background with raw material grit in both private and public sectors creating mixed-media installations, mural work and facilitating community art activations.\nThe artists approach to mediums includes latex, aerosol and up-cycled waste, working with the mechanical application of spray and the energy of hand brushed strokes (infused with powerful female portraits and garbage bits if possible).\nA Queen’s University graduate, Anya’s worked with various organizations, municipalities and businesses creating public art within communities around Toronto and internationally. Recent corporate projects include lead production on HideSeek, a 7000sq foot immersive art experience in Toronto and collaborations with BACARDI, QUO Makeup, Moroccanoil, DELL, RBC, 1800GOTJUNK and Chevrolet. Her commitment to her practice especially when aligned with public spaces is to create with purpose by giving nature a voice while defining a conversation with the viewer that may inspire and bring awareness for sustainable change.",

With his continued artistic development, illustration became his\ndeepest passion and talent. His desire to learn and absorb from his surroundings led him on a\npersonal creative journey. As a graduate of the Graphic Design program at Humber College\nwith over 10 years of working experience behind him, Adrian has established his place in\nToronto’s modern art community. His style is provocative and inspiring and defies\ncategorization. Blurring the lines between graffiti and ultra realism, Adrian’s voice and vision is\ninstantly identifiable. His works include countless portraits and illustrations for various\nmagazines and collaborations with the City of Toronto to develop murals for vacant community\nspaces. In the past Adrian has painted complete buildings and city blocks, designed award\nwinning video games and animated television shows. He has also successfully developed and\nfiled a functioning patent for the Stud Horse Foldable Drawing Bench and is the Principal and\nFounder of Behind the Front Visual Arts Studio.",

        "artist_bio": "My name is Jeff Blackburn and I am a visual artist based in Toronto. With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

Peru’s professional career started when he moved from Lima to Ottawa at 16; he won every Visual Arts Award in his high school, a Canadian Heritage grant to paint a mural in Vancouver for the International Earth Festival, and a 2 mural commission for the National Capital Commission. At age 20 he moved to Montreal where he continued winning prizes and awards from design contests at his local skateshop to the Millennium Excellence Scholarship.\n\nHis passion for art lead him to rise to the top of the local art scene working for brands and companies such as Bell, Cirque du Soleil and he painted a series of murals with the collective En Masse at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. With En Masse, Peru was part of dozens of collaborative murals throughout Canada, US, Mexico and China, and participated in mentorship programs with the Quebec English School Boards Association. He was also a central muralist for MU since its inception in 2007 and continues to work with them, most recently in 2020 where he will be painting the exterior of a high school.\n\nWhen Peru moved to Toronto a decade later he worked for Urban Outfitters for 5 years as a Lead Display Artist. In this role he built and installed window and store displays participating in store openings across North America including the company’s largest store opening at Herald Square in New York City. Peru used these experiences to expand his skill set and work on art installations at the Osheaga Music Festival as well for American Express for their Live Life Experience Installations around the world; All the while establishing himself as a muralist by assisting, collaborating, and consulting for nearly every arts organization in Toronto, and mentoring individuals, peers and on several occasions’ at-risk youth from the Oasis Skateboard Factory. Peru’s corporate and big brand murals allowed him to balance his work with grass-roots organizations, non-for-profits and BIA’s which make up most of his portfolio. Some of Peru’s corporate clients include Facebook, Nike, Adidas, Corus, Maple Leaf Sports, and Marriott Hotels.",

With his continued artistic development, illustration became his\ndeepest passion and talent. His desire to learn and absorb from his surroundings led him on a\npersonal creative journey. As a graduate of the Graphic Design program at Humber College\nwith over 10 years of working experience behind him, Adrian has established his place in\nToronto’s modern art community. His style is provocative and inspiring and defies\ncategorization. Blurring the lines between graffiti and ultra realism, Adrian’s voice and vision is\ninstantly identifiable. His works include countless portraits and illustrations for various\nmagazines and collaborations with the City of Toronto to develop murals for vacant community\nspaces. In the past Adrian has painted complete buildings and city blocks, designed award\nwinning video games and animated television shows. He has also successfully developed and\nfiled a functioning patent for the Stud Horse Foldable Drawing Bench and is the Principal and\nFounder of Behind the Front Visual Arts Studio.",

A distinctive character-based practice, the work of Elicser is highly visible in cities throughout Canada, South America and South Africa.

Elicser Elliott leads the charge in the character-based movement in Toronto and was voted ‘Best Local Graffiti Artist’ by NOW Magazine for 2011 through 2014. His work was recently featured at the Institute for Contemporary Culture at the Royal Ontario Museum, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, the Art Gallery of Ontario and at mural festivals in Hawaii and New York.",

        "artist_bio": "My name is Jeff Blackburn and I am a visual artist based in Toronto. With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

I believe in the values of the StART programs and have experienced the dedication of the team to carrying out these values through supporting and partnering.\n\nI am a visual artist passionate about arts engagement and education, collaborative art making, and murals. These practices bridge my background from a Bachelor of Fine Art in Drawing & Painting from OCAD University and a Community Arts Practice Certificate from York University. Since 2011, I have worn many ‘hats’ in the mural, art and community arts field; from artist, arts educator, facilitator, curator, arts administrator and project manager. I have had the opportunity to work and learn from these experiences, building adaptability and flexibility through working in unique situations including libraries, schools, art galleries, community centres, seniors centres, skate parks, abandoned storefronts (you name it!). I have built a strong rapport working with many artists and arts organizations such as Mural Routes, Vibe Arts, Nuit Blanche, Lakeshore Arts, Platform A, Scribble me Silly, Arts Etobicoke and East End Arts. In particular, I have worked closely with Mural Routes since 2011, as Program Coordinator, Facilitator, Curriculum Coordinator, and Program Director, with a focus on mentorship and the Mural Art Learning Institute programs.\n\nMy creative processes for involving community and youth in projects within their own neighbourhoods are based in facilitation style that creatively employs storytelling, brainstorming, and playful art techniques like collage to encourage conversations, confidence and to bring many ideas together into action. It gives me great joy to facilitate consultation, design, art making and mural making to bring community members together to reflect and re-imagine their neighbourhood. I love any opportunity to nurture participants’ creative abilities and create a safe space for exploration and connection through visual arts and storytelling. I see art as a tool for exploring themes, beginning conversation, gathering patterns and beginning important dialogue. Mural consultation and participation offers a space where artists and community members alike can share, exchange, grow and work together.",

In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

        "artist_bio": "Early on, I perceived that my ambition was the act of painting itself, finding that the process coincided with the workings of my conscious and unconscious mind.Throughout my career I have also been fascinated by realism, specifically trompe l’oeil and it’s ability to affect the viewer. I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

The shape, texture and location of a site and its history or current uses dictate the form and content of his projects. Dan’s public installations aim to open a dialog with viewers, promoting engagement through both intimate familiarity and wonder at the unexpected.\n\nDan has created public art projects for municipalities across Canada (Toronto, Mississauga, Ottawa, Gaspe, Calgary, Richmond), working in both two-dimensional mediums (murals, photo-based wheat pasting) and three dimensional sculpture. He has also been commissioned by the AGO, MOCA Toronto, the ROM and corporate clients Nike, Converse and Vespa., Born and raised in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood of Toronto, I have participated in the city's street art community for over 20 years as a graffiti and mural artist. My goal is to continue to bring life to the city through public art. When I create street art I work predominantly with spraypaint but I also work with oil on canvas as a professional artist represented by Ingram Gallery. I consider each project unique and like to incorporate the surrounding environment, wall structure, and community when developing a mural design and concept. Passing on skills to the next generation of artists is not only beneficial to the community, but myself as well. Through my previous mentorship work I have formed new friendships and learnt from others.",

His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

His work explores the juxtaposition of nature with human constructs through explorations into challenging humanities anthropocentric views towards ourselves and our environment. He merges historical approaches to realist and modern art to explore the nature vs culture divide through figures that examine various overlapping themes of anthropocenterism using natural and man made elements and materials.\nTed's work has exhibited in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Steamwhistle Gallery, the RMG, The Station Gallery, Nathan Phillips Square, Bluffs Gallery, the Super Wonder Gallery and his Sculptural Mural Installation is the centerpiece installation of the Aurora Cultural Centre in Aurora Ontario.\n\nIn paint I work with Aerosol and acrylic and Latex. In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

        "artist_bio": "Visual Artist\n\nChristiano De Araujo is a self-taught artist who was born in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. His earliest memory as a child is the moment when he discovered his love of art. As a toddler, he remembers picking up a crayon that his older sister had left behind. When she found that Christiano had taken it, she grabbed it away from him, but in that short amount of time, he had fallen in love with colours and the ability to create.\n\nHis love of art and his talent for the drawing were evident when he was a student in school. His first passion was comics and cartoons and at age 12 he drew his first comic strip.\n\nIn his late teens, Christiano began working for Brazil’s highly circulated newspaper, Diário da Manhã, doing editorial cartoons and illustrations. He also continued to work for other local newspapers and magazines. Realizing that he wanted more opportunities than he could have in Brazil, Christiano chose to immigrate to Canada.\n\nHis first years in Canada were a struggle. Early on, he landed a job as a Bricklayer, which he did for a number of years. Christiano confronted his weaknesses and discovered his strengths, learned to laugh at his hardships, quickly moving on. He was able to overcome any adversities with a determination to succeed and a desire to make himself a better man. This led to his artwork being published in numerous magazines and newspapers in Toronto.\n\nHe also credits his success to a spiritual awakening that he had through meditation and self-hypnosis. It gave him clarity and focus. This experience gave him more confidence and the ability to control his emotions and himself. Christiano devotes much of his life to his art. His endeavours include drawing, oil and acrylic painting, airbrushing, cartooning and sculpting. He is an artist by trade, finds art fun and likes to explore new media and innovated techniques.\n\nChristiano currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He is the founder of Toronto Artists Studio, a studio of visual artists, painters, digital artists and sculptors who design and produce murals and visual communication projects for audiences on a small and grand scale.\n\nAt the present moment, this very moment… Christiano is enjoying the wonderful interaction between the mind and the universe. This infinite universe in which we are all one!",

Labrona envisions his approach to murals as a celebration of residents + visitors, and, of nature.  The multi-coloured palate inherent in Labrona’s work embraces community values of family, diversity, inclusion and helping others.",

        "artist_bio": "I have previously created a site specific wall painting for StreetArt and enjoyed the process and dynamic result. So, would love the opportunity to create in a different setting as my speciality is site specific installation that draws on the expanded field of painting.\nMulti-media artist, Rolande Souliere is best known for her large-scale site specific immersive installations created from caution and street barrier tape to address how colonial infrastructures define, mark and control space and the inhabitants within them.\nFor a decade, Souliere has been working with material and metaphors of the road to address how systems, namely political and cultural systems inform, construct and impact personal and collective histories in contemporary society.\n\nUtilising repetitive strategies of wrapping, binding and layering, Souliere’s artworks incorporate reflective road signage, automobile headlights and brake lights, GPS systems, construction vests and delineators. These universal materials are stripped from their usual contexts, manipulated and repurposed into dynamic installations that discuss narratives that shape our understanding of infrastructural intervention, economic expansion and growth with the oncoming of colonial settlement.\n\nSouliere is a member of Michipicoten First Nation, born in Toronto, Canada and is an Australian citizen. Souliere became an artist after moving to Sydney in the late 1990s. She has a PhD from Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney.  A selection of Souliere’s international solo and group shows include Frequent Stopping III, IV and V (2018), Form and Content, Part I and II (2019) (2018), Indigenous Womxn Banner Project (2019), Future Memories (Present Tense) (2017),  Living Systems No. 2 (2017) and the touring cross Canada exhibition Beat Nation (2012-2014). Her public art commissions include Mediating the Treaties (2017-2018) commissioned by The City of Winnipeg, Frequent Stopping III for How far do you travel? (2018) with Translink BC and CAG, Vancouver and Bringing Back Wabakinine (2015) commissioned by City of Toronto.",

        "description": "Souliere’s mural for the Bala Underpass uses the colour symbolism of the Four Directions (red, white, black and yellow) in a way that simultaneously evokes the culture and spirituality of First Peoples’ beadwork and the visual language of barricades, urban roadways and boundaries.",

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

        "artist_bio": "Paula Gonzalez-Ossa is a mural artist who has been working with diverse communities producing street level public art, both in Canada and Latin America for over 25 years. Her ongoing work with StARToronto dates back to 2015. Her murals, like the most recent 500 ft. mural titled \"Our Medicines\"  located at the underpass at Dupont and Shaw, or \"The Ancestral Tree Spirits\" located at the Nordheimer Ravine's TTC station exit, depict a colourful  First Nations cosmovision in relation to the Original lands of Ontario, working closely with Anishnawbe  mentors, Elders and Knowledge Keepers. Gonzalez-Ossa is currently  the Indigenous Education Officer at the AGO’s Weston Learning Centre, as part of the Public Programming and Learning Department, and the Visual Arts instructor and mentoring artist at Na Me Res Sagatay Native Men's Residence. She brings 19 years experience as a  Community Youth Worker with youth at risk in Toronto's West.Some of her previous public works include: a 120 foot mural honoring First Nations from North and South America,  which was the recipient of  the 2014 Ward 27 City Builder’s Award, formerly at Allan Gardens. Other locations sport a ribbon-style mural at Women’s Residence, a women’s shelter at Dundas and Bathurst, in collaborations with an all women crew (2015), and a 4 wall rendition of the Medicine Wheel, inside of Na Me Res Sagatay’s courtyard (2016).  In sharp contrast she produced an indoor mural with 22 students from grades 6-8 at refugee host school Beverley Heights Middle School (2017).She recently served in the capacity of Resident Artist at the Power Plant gallery, developing mural arts programs at two satellite locations with youth from priority neighbouroods in Toronto’s West.(2017-2018). In 2018-2019 she worked closely with the 7Th Generation Image Makers at the Native Youth Resource Centre to mentor, facilitate and produce a mural with an all Indigenous women’s team, located  at the South facing wall at Christie Pits Park’s Alex Duff Memorial Pool. Her two most recent productions  funded by StART’s Partnership Grant in 2019,located at the front façade of Sagatay Naïve Men’s Residence, and the adjacent alley,  depict  “Medicines and Guardians”, as well as “The Wolves Running South”.Last but not least, Gonzalez-Ossa is one of the featured artists at the “You’ve Changed “ exhibit by STARToronto , at St Lawrence Market’s  “Market Gallery”. At the exhibit, the video display shows us her latest short documentary produced  for SART, about the basic protocols entailed when developing images in partnership with Indigenous Nations here in Canada.Gonzalez-Ossa  has been  voted Best Graffiti Artist for the City of Toronto by Now Magazine’s Reader’s Poll in 1997, in 2009, 2010, and 2011. In addition, she has been featured on  CBC (Radio and Television, varying shows), Much Music, MTV, Global Televison, City TV, TVO, CTV, Bell Fibe TV1, Rogers Television, and Telelatino, as well as various television  appearances in Chile, USA (NYC/California), and Jamaica.",
        "description": "The murals on all sides of the field house in Wells Hill Park illustrate the four seasons of life (childhood, adolescence, adulthood, elder) and identifies the park as a First Nations-friendly space, where residents and all community members can come to nature.",

        "artist_bio": "Amir Akbari is a Greater Toronto Area (GTA) based Visual Artist, Educator, Community Advocate and Entrepreneur.   In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

        "artist_bio": "I am a “maximalist” painter and believe “more is more” in art. I've been fortunate to be able to use art as a catalyst for community building and healing over the past decade plus, leading art groups for marginalized people, and creating large scale murals with youth in our community.\n\nThe first art movements that spoke to me were Surrealism, Expressionism, Graffiti and current street art. I usually hide a subtext within my work, that hints at broader social issues, but for the most part hope the viewer draws their own conclusions, creating a “choose your own adventure” story. No colours, patterns, or materials are off limits, and I enjoy mixing bits of history with comments on our digital, disposable, society.\n\nColour, texture, experimentation, and a sense of humour, are at the forefront of my creations.\n\nMy primary medium is acrylic based paints and treatments, due to flexible, resilient, and quick drying properties. I find acrylics span a range of price points and are accessible to all age groups. I have had success with acrylics for outdoor murals as they have good longevity and low VOC. I have also had success using an anti graffiti top coat, to remove the inevitable tags that show up once a mural is completed!\n\nBorn in Toronto, I was an avid sketcher and fashion designer, as a child. As a youth I spent most summers teaching arts and crafts to children.\n\nI completed a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from U of T and a diploma from OCAD in drawing and painting. In my third year I was selected for off campus study in Florence, Italy. I built a unique style of painting, which encompasses raw energy, and an eclectic approach to colour and material.\nI settled in Berlin for a few months, inspired by the street art and Expressionist tradition. Upon graduation I worked in a Harm Reduction program for youth, and a treatment centre creating art with adults with complex disabilities.\n\nI have continued to work with social service agencies in Toronto, using art as a tool for communication, healing, and strengthening community.\n\nI completed several community mural projects, including two youth engagement, street art mural projects.\n\nAfter my beloved mother died in 2017, I found it difficult to paint, and focused more on music production and performance. She was very proud of my mural work with youth, and I hope to pick this work back up in her honour.\n\nWorking with StART again, would allow me to continue to beautify our city, and continue to use art to promote inclusion, diversity, pride, and youth leadership. My past mural projects contained outward messages and representations of our city as a welcoming place that celebrates differences, and every type of human being, with all ranges of abilities reflected through art.\n\nI also bring a style which is fun and painterly and encourages community participation, weaving the style of other participants, into an overall cohesive design.",

In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

Through his affiliation with various local arts organizations he has gained vast experience as an arts mentor for at-risk youth initiatives. Bravo is a 4 time award winning painter and muralist and he lives and works in the city of Toronto, I'm a Toronto-based fine artist, illustrator and mural artist. I'm very inspired by the things around me, and the people in my life. I utilize a lot of different mediums into my art practice such as oils, acrylics, watercolour, ink, graphite, spray paint and exterior latex paint. I have been involved in various community-led projects, private and commercial mural commissions. The most impactful projects that I've been apart of, have led me to mentor youth artists and that has been the most rewarding part of those projects. An extension of youth mentorship, I'm also the Artist-in-Residence at Waterfront Neighbourhood Centre. I instruct Room 13, an international Studio that guides a growing network of student-run arts studios in schools and community settings globally.

        "artist_bio": "Born and raised in Toronto, I am a champion of this city. My work often depicts Toronto life - people, events and elements connected to the region. I have witnessed many changes and struggles in neighborhoods throughout the city and have contributed to developing community strength through several art projects.\nI choose to create art that can be seen and appreciated by the public, free and accessible to anyone - bringing beauty to dingy, neglected areas of town. I enjoy working with communities to engage them in the process of change, establish personal connections and develop a sense of pride in their neighborhood.\nMy goal is to work on a larger scale projects with StART. I would like to be mentored/assisted in the use of aerosol painting as well as high murals requiring a lift. Working with StART, I would love to work with an Indigenous artist/group on a co-operative project to learn, exchange information and cultural practices. Indigenous art including Woodland style, Inuit sculpture, drawing and printmaking, are my favourite styles of art.\nMy artwork also addresses environmental concerns/issues; reminding us that everything has a purpose, even when it is not clear to us, what that is. I often find inspiration in ecology, the environment and site-specific surroundings the mural will be in. Figures, the body, and movement are recurring themes in my art.\nAs well as being a painter, I have been a professional photographer for over 25 years, creating images digitally as well as on film. Previously, I was the Resident Photography Artist at Mississauga Living Art Centre. While working at the TDSB, I was honoured to photograph Nelson Mandela on his first visit to Toronto. I collaborated with teachers and students on several art projects including a handmade book given to Mr. Mandela.\nI am experienced in photographing events, fine art documentation, portraits, dance and theatre, products, buildings, magazine and commercial work. I also create digital designs including Op Art, tile patterns, floral, abstract; web design, preparing/repurposing images for web, email and print.\nMaterials and mediums I work with include photography, acrylic and latex paint, acrylic markers, aerosol paint, clay, wood and collage.\n\nI have graduated from 3 art programs: Central Technical School Adult Art Program, Ryerson Still Photography and Humber College Audio/Visual Technology. As a multidisciplinary artist, my unique combination of art and technology skills brings strength of understanding to all my projects. Working as a full-time artist and art educator, I teach painting, drawing, ceramics, mixed media and photography throughout the GTA, to seniors, adults and children.",

His work explores the juxtaposition of nature with human constructs through explorations into challenging humanities anthropocentric views towards ourselves and our environment. He merges historical approaches to realist and modern art to explore the nature vs culture divide through figures that examine various overlapping themes of anthropocenterism using natural and man made elements and materials.\nTed's work has exhibited in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Steamwhistle Gallery, the RMG, The Station Gallery, Nathan Phillips Square, Bluffs Gallery, the Super Wonder Gallery and his Sculptural Mural Installation is the centerpiece installation of the Aurora Cultural Centre in Aurora Ontario.\n\nIn paint I work with Aerosol and acrylic and Latex. In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

Spray Paint.\n\nThe exploration of self-dialogue with material and atmosphere, grants moments of incidental and intentional aesthetics. Art continues to form an inner dialogue between viewer and content. The unconscious movement through painting produces a learning experience for audience and artist. Visual elements and aesthetics within one’s control, judged and defined. Allow oneself to interact with the uncontrollable, to embrace the sense of boundless energy.\n\nI would love to share moments and experiences with a community audience to help influence creative growth and community connections using visual art.",

        "artist_bio": "Sean Martindale is an internationally recognized, award winning interdisciplinary artist and designer based in Toronto, Canada. His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

        "artist_bio": "Born and raised in Toronto, I have been a full-time professional mural artist for over 27 years. My mural career includes works for private, commercial, corporate clients, educational institutions and public art projects. One highlight of my career was working with acclaimed American artist Frank Stella as the Studio Manager for his studios in Toronto, New York and Houston, Texas. During this time the studio created large scale mixed media murals based on Mr. Stella’s paper collages.\nThese works were commissioned by international galleries and museums from Japan to Germany and included Torontoʼs Princess of Wales Theatre.\n\nI have worked with the StART team on several large scale projects and I have always been impressed with all of the support and encouragement that this program cultivates.  From the beginning, it was apparent how much the program focuses on bringing together artists and communities to create a lasting positive experience for all.  During the production of both my Park Lawn Underpass Mural and the Lake Shore Cycle Track Barrier Murals, I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback and response from the individuals driving, biking, riding and walking by these public pieces of art.  So much of an artists' time is spent creating a piece of artwork alone in the studio.  The StART program allows for an \"on the spot\" engagement with the community during the development of a mural.  For me, this is the most rewarding part of these murals.  I am proud to bring my artistic vision to these public works of art through the StART program for all to enjoy no matter what their background, social status or familiarity with a traditional gallery/museum setting.",

        "artist_bio": "I want to work with StART because the projects I have completed with Street Art Toronto's help have been not only the most enjoyable projects I have worked on in my career, but also the most lucrative for me, in terms of both payment and scale of exposure. I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

        "artist_bio": "I have been painting and drawing my whole life. I started, according to my mother, at age 4. She still has a great little ship drawing I did at that age. Drawing came easy to me but I had to work hard to be a good painter - I’m still working. Painting for me is a process of meditation; it’s a constant pursuit to describe the mental landscape as influenced by its surroundings.\n\tAs well as painting, I work as a photographer, shooting everything from events, editorials, and sometimes celebrities. My grandfather was an avid amateur photographer and gave me my first camera at a young age. Photography and painting have always gone hand in hand for me. One feeds the other. Photography as a tool has been employed by painters and artists since its invention. One could make a strong case that the advent of photography could not have been achieved without the help of painting and classical tools such as the camera obscura to help painters recreate scenes. I use photography in this way, creating images from reference subjects I capture.\n\tMy work is an ongoing process. I try not to just do one thing, I don’t think standing still and producing one product time and time again is a good thing. An artist has to be careful to not let their work become stale.\n \t1950s abstract expressionism is my jam. The New York school was a big influence on me as a young artist, but also the Montreal scene. The artist Jean-Paul Riopelle and Paul Emile Borduas were heroes of mine. Leader of the Automatistes and main author of the manifesto Refus Global, Borduas broke from all convention. I remember vividly seeing L’étoile Noir in person when I was young and being blown away by its bold simplicity. The surrealists also had a profound impact on my practice - specifically Dali for his character and brashness. His ambitious paintings and tight style always impressed  and humbled me.  H.R. Giger and Francis Bacon are also worth mentioning. Both artists’ approaches to painting were violent, sexual, and graphic. Food for the young artist.\n\tThe world is too interesting to not reflect on. The sublime and terrifying are always in front of us and we often have to ignore them to get on with our day. I like to allow my paintings to shape themselves in my mind. The painting comes to life on its own, almost independently of the creator. That’s often where the satisfaction comes from - surpassing your expectations and vision. The opposite is also true, and depressing. The failed painting can often take weeks or months to get over.",

His works are vibrant, colourful, abstract and fun, full of life and imagination, and accessible by people of all ages. His strong connection to Canada and, in particular, Toronto, is demonstrated by his works displayed, including Lee's Palace. At another recent internationally-recognized event, Runt was invited to represent Canada’s art scene as artistic lead for the International Fortune 500 event, held in September 2018, at Toronto’s Evergreen Brick Works, where he completed numerous art works including a 40-foot mural for an audience, comprised of international industry titans, policy and thought leaders, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nWhat Critics Have Said…:\n“Enter the world of Runt. At once familiar and unfamiliar, his works are of this world but definitely not of this world. Informed by a wide range of influences from Hieronymus Bosch to Dr. Seuss, Runt’s work embodies a love and critique of humanity as his monster scene-scapes play out in front of the viewer’s eyes. If one could press “play” on any of his scenes and advance them, the scenes would look entirely different. Runt’s characters capture the joy and aggression of our urban existence. But the beauty in Runt’s works is that they don't judge, they simply present. Known for his large murals, Lee’s Palace and The Electric Mud BBQ, Runt’s art is found in many private collections. Runt’s passionate adventure has turned into a career as one of Canada’s singular visionaries, on par with other 80s icons such as Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf.”\nRunt is interested in participating in the StArt project, as he looks forward to continuing his contributions to the Toronto arts scene and community, sharing his experiences and expertise with other artists while also learning from them.",

I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

She uses traditional printmaking and digital media to create illustrations and explore both historical and personal narratives.  In addition to illustration, she enjoys work on murals and self publishing comics with her collective, Grab Bag Club.  She studied at OCAD University, completing a bachelor of design and majoring in illustration. Her illustration work has been recognized by American Illustration, 3x3 Magazine and Creative Quarterly. Selected Clients include The Globe and Mail, CANADALAND, Cottage Life and Lenny Letter.\n\nI have worked with StART before, through the Lakeshore Bike Lane Murals, Concrete Barrier Art Program, and Outside the Box. I'd love to be involved in more group and individual mural projects, such as laneway mural projects or painting underpasses. I'm really open to any type of opportunity, though in the past I've worked with exterior latex paint for murals, as well as creating digital files to be printed and used as vinyl wraps.",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

For the past 8 years, Jarus has been working with communities across Canada and around the globe to produce large-scale portraits and figures among other images on wall surfaces. They can be found within major cities as well as across rural settings. He has had notable international recognition as a contemporary muralist and figurative painter. He studied briefly at the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto but attributes his knowledge of art to various influences including his grandmother, inspiration from graffiti, and resources found on the internet. The narrative Jarus depicts in his approach communicates a story of individual spirit relevant to the metabolism of that particular neighbourhood. A combination of acrylic, latex and aerosol paint is used to create representations of the people he’s inspired by along his travels. He enjoys painting in public space so that he can understand its context and express it through his work.",

I generally use bright shades of outdoor acrylics applied with rollers and brush, but occasionally I use spray paint. My subject matter is often nature-focused, depicting flowers insects and animals. Painting in the city, I want the organic, colourful images I create to shine in an otherwise muted and industrialized landscape. I want to create work that can be viewed by anyone, with a message of hope, growth and positive change.

Peru’s professional career started when he moved from Lima to Ottawa at 16; he won every Visual Arts Award in his high school, a Canadian Heritage grant to paint a mural in Vancouver for the International Earth Festival, and a 2 mural commission for the National Capital Commission. At age 20 he moved to Montreal where he continued winning prizes and awards from design contests at his local skateshop to the Millennium Excellence Scholarship.\n\nHis passion for art lead him to rise to the top of the local art scene working for brands and companies such as Bell, Cirque du Soleil and he painted a series of murals with the collective En Masse at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. With En Masse, Peru was part of dozens of collaborative murals throughout Canada, US, Mexico and China, and participated in mentorship programs with the Quebec English School Boards Association. He was also a central muralist for MU since its inception in 2007 and continues to work with them, most recently in 2020 where he will be painting the exterior of a high school.\n\nWhen Peru moved to Toronto a decade later he worked for Urban Outfitters for 5 years as a Lead Display Artist. In this role he built and installed window and store displays participating in store openings across North America including the company’s largest store opening at Herald Square in New York City. Peru used these experiences to expand his skill set and work on art installations at the Osheaga Music Festival as well for American Express for their Live Life Experience Installations around the world; All the while establishing himself as a muralist by assisting, collaborating, and consulting for nearly every arts organization in Toronto, and mentoring individuals, peers and on several occasions’ at-risk youth from the Oasis Skateboard Factory. Peru’s corporate and big brand murals allowed him to balance his work with grass-roots organizations, non-for-profits and BIA’s which make up most of his portfolio. Some of Peru’s corporate clients include Facebook, Nike, Adidas, Corus, Maple Leaf Sports, and Marriott Hotels.",

Since coming to Toronto he’s been creating intricate psychedelic artwork featuring animal and human subjects juxtaposed with abstract form. His paintings have been used for custom clothing design and his illustrations for band posters and psychedelic trance music events. As of 2012 Andre has been focused on murals and street art, working on wall art for private businesses and city sponsored projects.In his work Andre explores the use of bold colour, geometric shapes, space landscapes and his special interest in architectural and industrial design. Andre feels there’s an incredible necessity to self-express through art and equal need to inspire emerging artists to create and feel free to self-express themselves in their own ways.",

After living in Singapore for the last two years,  he has returned to Toronto to continue freelancing as a Mural / Graffiti Artist, Illustrator and Graphic Designer. In his early beginnings, his interest in visual communication was sparked by graffiti and street art. These forms influenced him heavily, his style reflecting the vibrant and often bold nature of urban art. This also encouraged the development of letters, calligraphy & characters which are a large part of his work.\n\nBlaze takes inspiration from all facets of his own life experiences, and strives to create imagery which reflects lessons that he has learned along with social commentary. He believes that large mural artwork in the public sphere has a responsibility to create questions in the viewers mind and encourage critical thinking. Blaze utilises spray paint and exterior latex to create his exterior and interior work. He strives to work with StART's amazing team to further develop his mural work, add to the already impressive visual landscape of Toronto, and also creating opportunities for emerging artists to grow and develop along side him.",

        "artist_bio": "Born and raised in Toronto, I am a champion of this city. My work often depicts Toronto life - people, events and elements connected to the region. I have witnessed many changes and struggles in neighborhoods throughout the city and have contributed to developing community strength through several art projects.\nI choose to create art that can be seen and appreciated by the public, free and accessible to anyone - bringing beauty to dingy, neglected areas of town. I enjoy working with communities to engage them in the process of change, establish personal connections and develop a sense of pride in their neighborhood.\nMy goal is to work on a larger scale projects with StART. I would like to be mentored/assisted in the use of aerosol painting as well as high murals requiring a lift. Working with StART, I would love to work with an Indigenous artist/group on a co-operative project to learn, exchange information and cultural practices. Indigenous art including Woodland style, Inuit sculpture, drawing and printmaking, are my favourite styles of art.\nMy artwork also addresses environmental concerns/issues; reminding us that everything has a purpose, even when it is not clear to us, what that is. I often find inspiration in ecology, the environment and site-specific surroundings the mural will be in. Figures, the body, and movement are recurring themes in my art.\nAs well as being a painter, I have been a professional photographer for over 25 years, creating images digitally as well as on film. Previously, I was the Resident Photography Artist at Mississauga Living Art Centre. While working at the TDSB, I was honoured to photograph Nelson Mandela on his first visit to Toronto. I collaborated with teachers and students on several art projects including a handmade book given to Mr. Mandela.\nI am experienced in photographing events, fine art documentation, portraits, dance and theatre, products, buildings, magazine and commercial work. I also create digital designs including Op Art, tile patterns, floral, abstract; web design, preparing/repurposing images for web, email and print.\nMaterials and mediums I work with include photography, acrylic and latex paint, acrylic markers, aerosol paint, clay, wood and collage.\n\nI have graduated from 3 art programs: Central Technical School Adult Art Program, Ryerson Still Photography and Humber College Audio/Visual Technology. As a multidisciplinary artist, my unique combination of art and technology skills brings strength of understanding to all my projects. Working as a full-time artist and art educator, I teach painting, drawing, ceramics, mixed media and photography throughout the GTA, to seniors, adults and children.",

I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

        "artist_bio": "I'm an Honors OCAD graduate in Fine Arts, a visual artist and community mural painter. My most recent project, The Richmond Hill Traffic Box Murals Project 2019 was made possible through a Richmond Hill Community and Cultural Grant.   I am a StART Concrete Barrier artist and I took part in the Lakeshore Barrier Bike Lane project in 2019. I have created murals for StreeARToronto, The F.H. Varley Art Gallery of Markham and The Toronto Public Library. Last September, I was a muralist for the 2018 StreetARToronto Light up the Laneway Project, (Euclid Palmerston Laneway), and I’ve been accepted three times for StreetARToronto Outside the Box Program.  In 2017 I executed a Canada 150 Bell Box Community Mural Project.  In Toronto, I was hired for the The Coxwell Laneway Mosaic at Coxwell TTC Subway in 2016. Other initiatives include Nuit Blanche and The Henderson CN Bridge Mural,(2014), revisited in January 2020.\nMy ideas are closely tied into Toronto Public Library, where I have worked for over 45 years as a public service worker. My recent positions there have included Children's Programming and Special Collections initiatives, where I have made use of my artistic skills to help community with library projects similar in scope to mural initiatives. Public service includes mural work.  It includes any tools that we can use to help community and helping community through the gifts I can offer has been my life's work.  Truly I believe that there are many avenues available to help needful communities achieve sustainability and gain a sense of pride, both where public spaces are concerned and where housing is concerned.  Mural making is just one of those tools - as are library materials and services, and other community initiatives.\n\nMy goals with StART include partnering the library or offering my librarianship skills to promote and to encourage any initiatives that might be developed by StART, through mural work, to connect the community with literacy in all it's forms, including digital and creative literacy. The way to reach community is to involve them in positive and exciting ways that will give them something of value to add to their lives. Again, there are so many ways we can do this - especially if our important various avenues public service can partner together in creative endeavours to mentor community.\nEvery day at the library or when we are painting murals on walls, we have opportunities to mentor others.  Sometimes this takes on a formal role and sometimes not, but every time we take an interest in a member of our community and show them something they need to know, this is mentoring. Every time we answer a question from a passerby about a project or initiative that has been built to help them - this is mentoring. If possible I would like to take part in a short term or small project mentoring program developed by StART, as I do in the library, with Children's STEM Programming.\n\nAgain, there are many avenues open to mentorship possibilities. I would;d be open to any and all of them, as developed by and at the discretion of StART. I have ideas that would lend themselves to partnership of library and mural making and public consultation for these ideas would include mentorship of community members. iMy most ambitious upcoming project is one I would like to submit next year to the StART Partnership program, to include a large library component to a mural initiative to be developed in central North York near a library.",

        "artist_bio": "My name is Jeff Blackburn and I am a visual artist based in Toronto. With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

        "artist_bio": "Visual Artist\n\nChristiano De Araujo is a self-taught artist who was born in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. His earliest memory as a child is the moment when he discovered his love of art. As a toddler, he remembers picking up a crayon that his older sister had left behind. When she found that Christiano had taken it, she grabbed it away from him, but in that short amount of time, he had fallen in love with colours and the ability to create.\n\nHis love of art and his talent for the drawing were evident when he was a student in school. His first passion was comics and cartoons and at age 12 he drew his first comic strip.\n\nIn his late teens, Christiano began working for Brazil’s highly circulated newspaper, Diário da Manhã, doing editorial cartoons and illustrations. He also continued to work for other local newspapers and magazines. Realizing that he wanted more opportunities than he could have in Brazil, Christiano chose to immigrate to Canada.\n\nHis first years in Canada were a struggle. Early on, he landed a job as a Bricklayer, which he did for a number of years. Christiano confronted his weaknesses and discovered his strengths, learned to laugh at his hardships, quickly moving on. He was able to overcome any adversities with a determination to succeed and a desire to make himself a better man. This led to his artwork being published in numerous magazines and newspapers in Toronto.\n\nHe also credits his success to a spiritual awakening that he had through meditation and self-hypnosis. It gave him clarity and focus. This experience gave him more confidence and the ability to control his emotions and himself. Christiano devotes much of his life to his art. His endeavours include drawing, oil and acrylic painting, airbrushing, cartooning and sculpting. He is an artist by trade, finds art fun and likes to explore new media and innovated techniques.\n\nChristiano currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He is the founder of Toronto Artists Studio, a studio of visual artists, painters, digital artists and sculptors who design and produce murals and visual communication projects for audiences on a small and grand scale.\n\nAt the present moment, this very moment… Christiano is enjoying the wonderful interaction between the mind and the universe. This infinite universe in which we are all one!",

His works are vibrant, colourful, abstract and fun, full of life and imagination, and accessible by people of all ages. His strong connection to Canada and, in particular, Toronto, is demonstrated by his works displayed, including Lee's Palace. At another recent internationally-recognized event, Runt was invited to represent Canada’s art scene as artistic lead for the International Fortune 500 event, held in September 2018, at Toronto’s Evergreen Brick Works, where he completed numerous art works including a 40-foot mural for an audience, comprised of international industry titans, policy and thought leaders, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nWhat Critics Have Said…:\n“Enter the world of Runt. At once familiar and unfamiliar, his works are of this world but definitely not of this world. Informed by a wide range of influences from Hieronymus Bosch to Dr. Seuss, Runt’s work embodies a love and critique of humanity as his monster scene-scapes play out in front of the viewer’s eyes. If one could press “play” on any of his scenes and advance them, the scenes would look entirely different. Runt’s characters capture the joy and aggression of our urban existence. But the beauty in Runt’s works is that they don't judge, they simply present. Known for his large murals, Lee’s Palace and The Electric Mud BBQ, Runt’s art is found in many private collections. Runt’s passionate adventure has turned into a career as one of Canada’s singular visionaries, on par with other 80s icons such as Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf.”\nRunt is interested in participating in the StArt project, as he looks forward to continuing his contributions to the Toronto arts scene and community, sharing his experiences and expertise with other artists while also learning from them., I had the privilege to make a mural with StART and Mural Routes in 2017 (Underpass Park). I really enjoyed this experience and would like to renew it by realizing, this time, a larger work. I find StART's approach involving the community in the process of setting up murals in the city very interesting. I also appreciate the openness of the organization to the diversity of aesthetics and the freedom of creation that it allows. If a project with StART could be possible, a larger scale project, I will be interested to be assisted by local artists in the realization of the work, for a mutual enrichment.\n\nI am interested in the pictorial representation of patterns and textile materials of various origins, their symbolic values, and the senses created by their juxtaposition and context. My creations revisit the traditional notions of trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) to create textile landscapes from which emanates an enveloping atmosphere. My works take the shape of organic patchworks: their sampled components differ in patterns, colors and origins. They express coherent and structured ensembles.\n\nI come from Quebec City and I live and practice in Montreal since 2006. I hold a DESS in Management of Cultural Organizations from HEC Montréal, and I obtained my Bachelor degree in Visual Arts at Laval University in 2002. I've done my first mural in 2000. I’m a professional member of the Conseil des métiers d'art du Québec since 2005, an organization that recognizes mural art as a profession.\n\nI am mainly dedicated to mural art since the end of my Bachelor's degree in visual arts. I have accomplished or participated in the realization of dozens of large-format projects, as site and team manager, designer, teacher or assistant. I have realized many large-scale projects, many of them in partnership with MU organization from Montreal. I have also worked for various companies operating in the field of mural art, decorative arts and scenic scenery. On the international scene, I was invited in 2001 by the city of Namur in Belgium to paint a collaborative work. In 2005, I have done a mural art training at Cité-Création, in Oullins, France. In 2006 and 2019, I was invited to Mexico City to lead the realization of collaborative murals for the Faro de Oriente Cultural Center. I also participated in the Street Art 2017 event of Robespierre Gallery in Grande-Synthe, the Festival Internacional de Arte Urbano Barrio Vivo and the CIMU Festival in Mexico City in 2019. I also participated this year in the Imagine Mural Festival of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nI mainly work with exterior or interior acrylic paints, applied by brush, roller or paint gun. The various projects I did led me to work on various media such as brick, plaster, concrete, crezon and PVC. I have been working in scaffolding since 2000. I have my license to operate lifting platforms since 2011, and license for basket lift since 2015. I also attended the general health course on construction sites in 2010., Christopher Ross (aka GAWD) is a surrealist artist from Montreal. Ross has created murals and exhibition pieces in various Canadian and international cities and has been an important part of Montréal’s street art community since the nineties.\n\nAmong the hundreds of jobs Christopher completed while pursuing art, was fixing egg machines. Christopher soon discovered the ink used to date eggs was an interesting medium for painting,  directly influencing his signature splatters and eventually the use of liquid watercolour. Along with occasional access to painting materials, Christopher’s various jobs made him more aware of the working class struggle, and, relationships among people, nature and the environment., Biography: Monique Aura Bedard is a Onyota'a: ka (Oneida) artist, currently based in Tkaronto. She graduated from the University of Lethbridge with a BFA (Studio Art) and is a DTATI Candidate. Through her art practice, she focuses on art as healing, identity, empowerment, and mothering. She looks to the community to collectively explore personal storytelling and truth-sharing.\n\nArtist Statement: I am inspired by storytelling and healing, individually and as a community. Currently, I combine painting, drawing, beadwork, textiles, image transfers, and collage to express my own stories. I aim to address intergenerational trauma with an emphasis on intergenerational healing to communicate experiences from the inside out. By unearthing my own stories, I can strengthen connections where the process creates awareness and understanding; this experience is ultimately part of the healing journey.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

        "artist_bio": "Amir Akbari is a Greater Toronto Area (GTA) based Visual Artist, Educator, Community Advocate and Entrepreneur.   In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

Cote studied Beaux-Arts Style painting/drawing at OCAD under the direction of Carmen Cereceda Bianchi (Diego Rivera’s assistant).\n\nPhilip Cote emphasizes the resurgent power of nature and the importance of listening to Indigenous teachings through his Mural Art. lluminating 13,500+ years of Indigenous peoples history on Turtle Island showing their cosmology, mapping their place within the Universe and its beginnings, with light and dark showing their world linked to the underworld (Underwater World) and spirit world (Sky World).\n\nIn 2017, Cote received a grant from the Toronto Arts Council to create a mural depicting the Niagara Treaty for University of Toronto’s Massey College with the theme of Truth and Reconciliation/Canada 150.\n\nCote has been a tour guide with First Story since 1999, a three-hour tour providing an Indigenous history of Toronto uncovering the last 13,500 years. Cote’s academic practice includes public speaking, land acknowledgements, Indigenous Cosmology and cultural interpretation offered at York University, the Art Gallery of Ontario, University of Toronto, Ryerson University, OCAD University, and the Toronto District School Board through the Aboriginal Education Centre. In these Institutions, Cote shares his knowledge on the teachings of the Seven Grandfathers, the Medicine Wheel, Pipe, Naming and Sacred Fire Ceremonies, and the History of the Land.\n\nAs an Indigenous painter and Muralist, the purpose of Cote’s research is to unearth, and reveal, his cultural experience and knowledge of signs of Indigenous symbols, language and interpretation. Openings are thus created both within the archive/academia and broader public that enable these imbedded stereotypes to transform under the gaze of an Indigenous based interpreted presence and intervene in the cross generational colonial bias., Kwest is a key pioneer in the fusion of graffiti and sculpture approaching public art opportunities\nholistically as a self-taught carpenter and designer. He has a unique ability to create site-specific\ninstallations, which maintain relevance to the location while emphasizing contemporary aesthetics.\n\nKwest has completed projects for Evergreen Brick Works Pillar Murals (Toronto), UP Here Festival (Sudbury - Largest Mural in Canada), Tweed (Smith Falls, ON), and the Roskilde Festival (Denmark). For Toronto's Nuit Blanche 2017, Kwest collaborated with Drake music producer, Noah “40” Shebib in an interactive sculptural installation, “TRUTH”, at Yonge and Dundas Square. Blending his different crafts allows for a new style of mural + sculpture rooted in the project’s neighbourhood, as much as it is shaped by his knowledge of graffiti, building and designing indoor and outdoor spaces., Emmanuel Jarus is a Canadian-born artist and muralist inspired by the visual human experience. His work reimagines how art can exist in public spaces. For the past 8 years, Jarus has been working with communities across Canada and around the globe to produce large-scale portraits and figures among other images on wall surfaces. They can be found within major cities as well as across rural settings. He has had notable international recognition as a contemporary muralist and figurative painter. He studied briefly at the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto but attributes his knowledge of art to various influences including his grandmother, inspiration from graffiti, and resources found on the internet. The narrative Jarus depicts in his approach communicates a story of individual spirit relevant to the metabolism of that particular neighbourhood. A combination of acrylic, latex and aerosol paint is used to create representations of the people he’s inspired by along his travels. He enjoys painting in public space so that he can understand its context and express it through his work.",

Her ongoing work with StARToronto dates back to 2015. Her murals, like the most recent 500 ft. mural titled \"Our Medicines\"  located at the underpass at Dupont and Shaw, or \"The Ancestral Tree Spirits\" located at the Nordheimer Ravine's TTC station exit, depict a colourful  First Nations cosmovision in relation to the Original lands of Ontario, working closely with Anishnawbe  mentors, Elders and Knowledge Keepers. Gonzalez-Ossa is currently  the Indigenous Education Officer at the AGO’s Weston Learning Centre, as part of the Public Programming and Learning Department, and the Visual Arts instructor and mentoring artist at Na Me Res Sagatay Native Men's Residence. She brings 19 years experience as a  Community Youth Worker with youth at risk in Toronto's West.Some of her previous public works include: a 120 foot mural honoring First Nations from North and South America,  which was the recipient of  the 2014 Ward 27 City Builder’s Award, formerly at Allan Gardens. Other locations sport a ribbon-style mural at Women’s Residence, a women’s shelter at Dundas and Bathurst, in collaborations with an all women crew (2015), and a 4 wall rendition of the Medicine Wheel, inside of Na Me Res Sagatay’s courtyard (2016).  In sharp contrast she produced an indoor mural with 22 students from grades 6-8 at refugee host school Beverley Heights Middle School (2017).She recently served in the capacity of Resident Artist at the Power Plant gallery, developing mural arts programs at two satellite locations with youth from priority neighbouroods in Toronto’s West.(2017-2018). In 2018-2019 she worked closely with the 7Th Generation Image Makers at the Native Youth Resource Centre to mentor, facilitate and produce a mural with an all Indigenous women’s team, located  at the South facing wall at Christie Pits Park’s Alex Duff Memorial Pool. Her two most recent productions  funded by StART’s Partnership Grant in 2019,located at the front façade of Sagatay Naïve Men’s Residence, and the adjacent alley,  depict  “Medicines and Guardians”, as well as “The Wolves Running South”.Last but not least, Gonzalez-Ossa is one of the featured artists at the “You’ve Changed “ exhibit by STARToronto , at St Lawrence Market’s  “Market Gallery”. At the exhibit, the video display shows us her latest short documentary produced  for SART, about the basic protocols entailed when developing images in partnership with Indigenous Nations here in Canada.Gonzalez-Ossa  has been  voted Best Graffiti Artist for the City of Toronto by Now Magazine’s Reader’s Poll in 1997, in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

With his continued artistic development, illustration became his\ndeepest passion and talent. His desire to learn and absorb from his surroundings led him on a\npersonal creative journey. As a graduate of the Graphic Design program at Humber College\nwith over 10 years of working experience behind him, Adrian has established his place in\nToronto’s modern art community. His style is provocative and inspiring and defies\ncategorization. Blurring the lines between graffiti and ultra realism, Adrian’s voice and vision is\ninstantly identifiable. His works include countless portraits and illustrations for various\nmagazines and collaborations with the City of Toronto to develop murals for vacant community\nspaces. In the past Adrian has painted complete buildings and city blocks, designed award\nwinning video games and animated television shows. He has also successfully developed and\nfiled a functioning patent for the Stud Horse Foldable Drawing Bench and is the Principal and\nFounder of Behind the Front Visual Arts Studio.",

        "artist_bio": "Sean Martindale is an internationally recognized, award winning interdisciplinary artist and designer based in Toronto, Canada. His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

        "artist_bio": "Paula Gonzalez-Ossa is a mural artist who has been working with diverse communities producing street level public art, both in Canada and Latin America for over 25 years. Her ongoing work with StARToronto dates back to 2015. Her murals, like the most recent 500 ft. mural titled \"Our Medicines\"  located at the underpass at Dupont and Shaw, or \"The Ancestral Tree Spirits\" located at the Nordheimer Ravine's TTC station exit, depict a colourful  First Nations cosmovision in relation to the Original lands of Ontario, working closely with Anishnawbe  mentors, Elders and Knowledge Keepers. Gonzalez-Ossa is currently  the Indigenous Education Officer at the AGO’s Weston Learning Centre, as part of the Public Programming and Learning Department, and the Visual Arts instructor and mentoring artist at Na Me Res Sagatay Native Men's Residence. She brings 19 years experience as a  Community Youth Worker with youth at risk in Toronto's West.Some of her previous public works include: a 120 foot mural honoring First Nations from North and South America,  which was the recipient of  the 2014 Ward 27 City Builder’s Award, formerly at Allan Gardens. Other locations sport a ribbon-style mural at Women’s Residence, a women’s shelter at Dundas and Bathurst, in collaborations with an all women crew (2015), and a 4 wall rendition of the Medicine Wheel, inside of Na Me Res Sagatay’s courtyard (2016).  In sharp contrast she produced an indoor mural with 22 students from grades 6-8 at refugee host school Beverley Heights Middle School (2017).She recently served in the capacity of Resident Artist at the Power Plant gallery, developing mural arts programs at two satellite locations with youth from priority neighbouroods in Toronto’s West.(2017-2018). In 2018-2019 she worked closely with the 7Th Generation Image Makers at the Native Youth Resource Centre to mentor, facilitate and produce a mural with an all Indigenous women’s team, located  at the South facing wall at Christie Pits Park’s Alex Duff Memorial Pool. Her two most recent productions  funded by StART’s Partnership Grant in 2019,located at the front façade of Sagatay Naïve Men’s Residence, and the adjacent alley,  depict  “Medicines and Guardians”, as well as “The Wolves Running South”.Last but not least, Gonzalez-Ossa is one of the featured artists at the “You’ve Changed “ exhibit by STARToronto , at St Lawrence Market’s  “Market Gallery”. At the exhibit, the video display shows us her latest short documentary produced  for SART, about the basic protocols entailed when developing images in partnership with Indigenous Nations here in Canada.Gonzalez-Ossa  has been  voted Best Graffiti Artist for the City of Toronto by Now Magazine’s Reader’s Poll in 1997, in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

He is best known for his colourful works lining the alleys and streets of Toronto and achieved international recognition.  Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto.",

Art making has been a life affirming escape and a way to process his surroundings. OCAD opened his eyes to different approaches and techniques. Focusing on the dissection of colour and light into geometric shapes and patterns, Jason's artwork creates a juxtaposition between the abstract and the representational. This style lends well to a mural site and its organic blend into the community. Thinking critically about the transformation of public spaces, Jason looks for interesting ways to use colour, form, and shape to create visual landmarks to promote and evolve the aesthetic narrative of the city.\n\nMost recently, his commercial commissions include: Yonge + Dundas Square Toronto Musician series, Fet Zun restaurant exterior signage, Ubisoft Assasin's Creed Fan Mural, and, MLB Blue Jays temporary mural at Union Station.",

        "artist_bio": "Working with StArt and seeing the positive impact it has on neighbourhoods, people and the development of artists is inspiring and makes me proud to be a part of.\n\nCanadian graffiti artist Alexander Bacon began painting in the 90’s as a teenager.  He is best known for his colourful works lining the alleys and streets of Toronto and achieved international recognition.  Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto., I am a Nipissing First Nation born artist. I started life learning my cultures teachings, approaches and ceremonies through visual healing art forms. Painting, dancing, leatherwork and story telling were taught through traditional Ojibway and Odawa ways. My mentors encouraged me to be creative and to not let anything go to waste with what I share in art.\nAs a traditional Anishnawbe first nations graffiti artist, my work has matured from quick pieces into large street art projects and canvas work. Using my teachings and different methods I focus on unique painting styles and techniques to create smooth transitions of colour, blending abstract form with realism and expressionism.\nI take interactions of my daily life, the city I live in and my Anishnawbe culture. I use it as a challenge for me to try out new styles and incorporate new subject matter. My love of nature and animals is prominent through my work because of its deep meaning and connection to life. I aspire for my artistic evolution to form a distinct look and feeling.\nI call my style, Making the woodlands dance. Norval Morrisseau best describes how I approach my painting, he says as “If you can imagine an x-ray photo of spirit”. My goal\nis to portray the teachings of my ancestors, sacred geometry and shapes in all my art forms.\nMy art has allowed me to work closely with art directors, city officials and corporate clients to make their visions come to life. I enjoy working with people and have collaborated with many artists on projects of all scales from graphic books to videos to murals around the world. I love travelling and seeing art. Most of all, I love to paint and have people enjoy my work.\nb.\nI’m always inspired by new opportunities to share my art. I am grateful to have the ability to transform neighborhoods, buildings and interior and turn them into popular destinations for people to visit, admire and enjoy. Working on murals allows me to engage in the community, bring people together and inspire others.\nc.\nOver the years, I have worked with community led designs which allow me to bring the community’s vision to life. I work closely with team members to ensure everyone has a\nclear understanding and vision of the design required to meet the project expectations. In the past I have worked as the project lead and director on numerous projects and have extensive experience with coordinating artists of various skill sets and backgrounds. I am\n\nflexible and easy to work with, good at problem solving, communicating, and can work in any situation.",

I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

I generally use bright shades of outdoor acrylics applied with rollers and brush, but occasionally I use spray paint. My subject matter is often nature-focused, depicting flowers insects and animals. Painting in the city, I want the organic, colourful images I create to shine in an otherwise muted and industrialized landscape. I want to create work that can be viewed by anyone, with a message of hope, growth and positive change.

For the past 8 years, Jarus has been working with communities across Canada and around the globe to produce large-scale portraits and figures among other images on wall surfaces. They can be found within major cities as well as across rural settings. He has had notable international recognition as a contemporary muralist and figurative painter. He studied briefly at the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto but attributes his knowledge of art to various influences including his grandmother, inspiration from graffiti, and resources found on the internet. The narrative Jarus depicts in his approach communicates a story of individual spirit relevant to the metabolism of that particular neighbourhood. A combination of acrylic, latex and aerosol paint is used to create representations of the people he’s inspired by along his travels. He enjoys painting in public space so that he can understand its context and express it through his work.",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

However, recently I've been getting more into creating murals for commercials spaces (with spray paint and house paint) and would really love to participate and learn more from StrART projects and how the organization beautifies the city. Generally, my work is influenced by how colours and how they shape a subject can express universal stories or emotions especially applying them on portraits to elaborate on the subject's nuanced story/mood. Since my work is essentially influenced by formless colours and emotions, my process basically involves trying to form or incorporate these colours/shapes into the subject I'm reinterpreting into my style. My overall goal for getting involved with StART is to essentially learn and challenge myself in new ways to express that colourful vision.",

Visual elements and aesthetics within one’s control, judged and defined.

The wall features 28 portraits of Peoples named by the local community and 'framed' with floral designs. The name and Nation of each individual will appear under each portrait along with a quote/teaching they have given in relation to the Land, creating an entranceway into traditional ecological knowledge and an awareness of the planet's fragility. It is my intention that all who see this mural will gain a better understanding of where they are located geographically, be reminded that Toronto is located upon Indigenous territory, and deepen their consciousness politically, socially and environmentally.”\n\nIn Water Wall (east side of the underpass), the Artist honours water teachings and those who walk for the water, such as Anishinaabe Elder and water-rights advocateJosephine Mandamin.

After assisting both friends and professionals with their own murals over the years, I earned opportunities to paint an Outside the Box mural in 2017 (Wilson and Dufferin) and a Bell Box Mural in 2019 (College and University). I’m incredibly grateful to have had opportunities to paint the streets of Toronto, and had wonderful experiences interacting with the community while creating each artwork.",

I feel like a multi-faceted artist, having received a graphic design degree at OCADU in 2012 i tend to stratal the line between designer and artist. My passion is painting, but i have a real eye for design and typography\n\nI often work with my concepts digitally, mostly on adobe illustrator and photoshop, sometimes even design and self publish books of my photography and painting.\n\n My interest in public art comes from my roots in skateboarding. The experience of using the downtown as a space to skate  exposed me to graffiti and street art. From a young age I began to take note of the writing and imagery on the walls. At age 13 i began my endeavour into the graffiti culture. Today, 17 years later,  still a practitioner, i want to stay connected and collaborate with the new generation of artists working here in toronto, i think stART is great for that connection. Creating art in public space is very important to me, i believe cities with little public art are dead cities, narrow minded cities. I judge a city based on how colourful the streets are!\n\nPrevious murals i've painted in the city have been graffiti productions or have been more straight-forward text based installations. Recently I've moved some of my painting practice back to the studio, creating landscape work that borders the line of impressionism and abstraction.\n\ni use various mediums, fluent in spray paint, acrylic brush work,  vector based work, sculpture and installation",

        "artist_bio": "MEDIAH has proved that he can execute a mural project of this scale as he has worked with the Street Art Toronto staff for over the past five years to execute 5 large-scale, landmark art murals around the City (RADI’AAL ENCOMPASS mural on the Woodbine/Gerrard bridge underpass, TERRA STRAT’AA bridge on the Leslie/Eglinton Ave underpass, Leslieville Bike Share mural, LANTERN SHELL murals on O’Connor Drive, and the wrapped DRIFT APPENDAR mural for Westbury National on Warden Ave, in Scarborough). In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

I am especially curious about the interactions of people in public places and how to create meaning in the urban environment. I am motivated by a desire to contribute to city building. For the past 15 years, I have worked for some of the world’s best landscape architecture firms in Toronto and beyond.\n\nAs a designer, my focus is on the seen and unseen: the influence of soil and water on vegetation and the effect of seasons or time of use. My creative works bring attention to ephemeral and subtle materials such as air, water, decay, light and shadow. I am motivated to make visible the natural processes and histories of our surrounding environment. In recent years, I have completed temporary and permanent installations for the Toronto Design Offsite Festival, Grow Op at the Gladstone Hotel, and Luminato. Current interests include exploring color on a daily basis (@366daysofcolor) and using color to create objects that tell a personal story.\n\nAs a muralist, I am keen to explore colour, texture and material. Completed in 2018, \"Gradation\" is a 12,000 sq’ outdoor mural of stylized colour changes moving from blue to green and informed by the existing vegetation and building materials on the West Toronto Railpath. Ideas that merge past and present history as well as local ecologies are key components of my work. Nothing is a blank slate; subsequent mural projects tie into themes connecting colour with existing material and texture.\n\nWorking with StART has opened new possibilities and synergies between landscape and art in the public realm. I am motivated to explore new mural projects, mixed-media art projects and expanding connections through networking and community building.",

Play and discovery are key to her practice, especially when she gets a chance to work on a mural.\n\nAs a Latinx illustrator, I like to focus on representation and cultural diversity in my work. I strive to create imagery that expresses a sense of inclusiveness and community.

I am especially curious about the interactions of people in public places and how to create meaning in the urban environment. I am motivated by a desire to contribute to city building. For the past 15 years, I have worked for some of the world’s best landscape architecture firms in Toronto and beyond.\n\nAs a designer, my focus is on the seen and unseen: the influence of soil and water on vegetation and the effect of seasons or time of use. My creative works bring attention to ephemeral and subtle materials such as air, water, decay, light and shadow. I am motivated to make visible the natural processes and histories of our surrounding environment. In recent years, I have completed temporary and permanent installations for the Toronto Design Offsite Festival, Grow Op at the Gladstone Hotel, and Luminato. Current interests include exploring color on a daily basis (@366daysofcolor) and using color to create objects that tell a personal story.\n\nAs a muralist, I am keen to explore colour, texture and material. Completed in 2018, \"Gradation\" is a 12,000 sq’ outdoor mural of stylized colour changes moving from blue to green and informed by the existing vegetation and building materials on the West Toronto Railpath. Ideas that merge past and present history as well as local ecologies are key components of my work. Nothing is a blank slate; subsequent mural projects tie into themes connecting colour with existing material and texture.\n\nWorking with StART has opened new possibilities and synergies between landscape and art in the public realm. I am motivated to explore new mural projects, mixed-media art projects and expanding connections through networking and community building.",

His works are vibrant, colourful, abstract and fun, full of life and imagination, and accessible by people of all ages. His strong connection to Canada and, in particular, Toronto, is demonstrated by his works displayed, including Lee's Palace. At another recent internationally-recognized event, Runt was invited to represent Canada’s art scene as artistic lead for the International Fortune 500 event, held in September 2018, at Toronto’s Evergreen Brick Works, where he completed numerous art works including a 40-foot mural for an audience, comprised of international industry titans, policy and thought leaders, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nWhat Critics Have Said…:\n“Enter the world of Runt. At once familiar and unfamiliar, his works are of this world but definitely not of this world. Informed by a wide range of influences from Hieronymus Bosch to Dr. Seuss, Runt’s work embodies a love and critique of humanity as his monster scene-scapes play out in front of the viewer’s eyes. If one could press “play” on any of his scenes and advance them, the scenes would look entirely different. Runt’s characters capture the joy and aggression of our urban existence. But the beauty in Runt’s works is that they don't judge, they simply present. Known for his large murals, Lee’s Palace and The Electric Mud BBQ, Runt’s art is found in many private collections. Runt’s passionate adventure has turned into a career as one of Canada’s singular visionaries, on par with other 80s icons such as Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf.”\nRunt is interested in participating in the StArt project, as he looks forward to continuing his contributions to the Toronto arts scene and community, sharing his experiences and expertise with other artists while also learning from them.",

After living in Singapore for the last two years,  he has returned to Toronto to continue freelancing as a Mural / Graffiti Artist, Illustrator and Graphic Designer. In his early beginnings, his interest in visual communication was sparked by graffiti and street art. These forms influenced him heavily, his style reflecting the vibrant and often bold nature of urban art. This also encouraged the development of letters, calligraphy & characters which are a large part of his work.\n\nBlaze takes inspiration from all facets of his own life experiences, and strives to create imagery which reflects lessons that he has learned along with social commentary. He believes that large mural artwork in the public sphere has a responsibility to create questions in the viewers mind and encourage critical thinking. Blaze utilises spray paint and exterior latex to create his exterior and interior work. He strives to work with StART's amazing team to further develop his mural work, add to the already impressive visual landscape of Toronto, and also creating opportunities for emerging artists to grow and develop along side him.",

I'd love to continue working with StART and be part of this art movement!\nBio: My artistic work is the result of my experiences living and working in various parts of Latin America. The rich and vibrant cultures of the places I’ve visited have been my main inspiration to create and share my artistic vision with others. As a Canadian-Colombian artist is empowering for me to paint around the themes of culture, nature, and identity enriching Canadian multiculturalism. Most of my murals are found in Canada and Colombia, my wish is to continue painting across Canada and the world.",

I have been creating public and street art in some fashion since childhood.  I’ve painted from coast to coast and internationally as well as for a range of clients from charities to mom and pops shops to multinational corporations. I’ve worked on several StART programs over the years and truly appreciate the projects and processes that the team puts forward. I’ve been fortunate enough to engage with artists, cultural representatives, and residents through these city programs. People I might otherwise not have connected and built relationships with, which is why I hope to continue to create, Grow and learn with the StART team in this great place we call Toronto.",

After living in Singapore for the last two years,  he has returned to Toronto to continue freelancing as a Mural / Graffiti Artist, Illustrator and Graphic Designer. In his early beginnings, his interest in visual communication was sparked by graffiti and street art. These forms influenced him heavily, his style reflecting the vibrant and often bold nature of urban art. This also encouraged the development of letters, calligraphy & characters which are a large part of his work.\n\nBlaze takes inspiration from all facets of his own life experiences, and strives to create imagery which reflects lessons that he has learned along with social commentary. He believes that large mural artwork in the public sphere has a responsibility to create questions in the viewers mind and encourage critical thinking. Blaze utilises spray paint and exterior latex to create his exterior and interior work. He strives to work with StART's amazing team to further develop his mural work, add to the already impressive visual landscape of Toronto, and also creating opportunities for emerging artists to grow and develop along side him.",

I believe in the values of the StART programs and have experienced the dedication of the team to carrying out these values through supporting and partnering.\n\nI am a visual artist passionate about arts engagement and education, collaborative art making, and murals. These practices bridge my background from a Bachelor of Fine Art in Drawing & Painting from OCAD University and a Community Arts Practice Certificate from York University. Since 2011, I have worn many ‘hats’ in the mural, art and community arts field; from artist, arts educator, facilitator, curator, arts administrator and project manager. I have had the opportunity to work and learn from these experiences, building adaptability and flexibility through working in unique situations including libraries, schools, art galleries, community centres, seniors centres, skate parks, abandoned storefronts (you name it!). I have built a strong rapport working with many artists and arts organizations such as Mural Routes, Vibe Arts, Nuit Blanche, Lakeshore Arts, Platform A, Scribble me Silly, Arts Etobicoke and East End Arts. In particular, I have worked closely with Mural Routes since 2011, as Program Coordinator, Facilitator, Curriculum Coordinator, and Program Director, with a focus on mentorship and the Mural Art Learning Institute programs.\n\nMy creative processes for involving community and youth in projects within their own neighbourhoods are based in facilitation style that creatively employs storytelling, brainstorming, and playful art techniques like collage to encourage conversations, confidence and to bring many ideas together into action. It gives me great joy to facilitate consultation, design, art making and mural making to bring community members together to reflect and re-imagine their neighbourhood. I love any opportunity to nurture participants’ creative abilities and create a safe space for exploration and connection through visual arts and storytelling. I see art as a tool for exploring themes, beginning conversation, gathering patterns and beginning important dialogue. Mural consultation and participation offers a space where artists and community members alike can share, exchange, grow and work together.",

StART’s vision to create beautiful and safer public spaces with a mandate to act inclusively, celebrate our strengths in diversity, to acknowledge and respect the cultures and lands of Indigenous persons, and mentor emerging talents, all reflect my own values in my professional and personal life.\n\nI’ve been an artist for 20 years in the public realm, having exhibited in public art galleries, artist-run centres, art festivals, and having worked with public/private planning teams to create permanent public art with budgets up to $56,000.00 (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital). I work in several disciplines including sculpture (polyurethane resins, concrete, casting techniques), installation art (interactive works that light up, make noise, or move - typically destined for art festivals/events such as Nuit Blanche, Animating Our Waterfront, Hamilton Supercrawl), and painting murals.\n\nMy passion for community arts participation cemented over 15 years ago when I sat on the board of Carfac Ontario as Vice Chair, with Merlin Homer as Chair, a Mohawk Elder whom I consider as a mentor. We had an exceptional team of strong arts leaders and my experience at Carfac helped mould my understanding of fair remuneration, cultural/ethnic/language/gender challenges that artists’ face, and the importance of advocating for one another’s communities.  Profoundly affected by this experience, I’ve continued to work with communities and have co-founded three successful art collectives, Open Field Collective, KJ Bit, and Creativo Collective, whose mandates are to create artwork and murals in public spaces while being inclusive of surrounding communities. In 2017, the Open Field Collective was awarded the national ArtBridges award for “Innovation” in recognition of our dedication to community engagement and our “Street Projects” where we invented miniature art galleries to create and display artwork in public spaces such as residential front yards, King Street (Public Realm), and Guelph. We’ve partnered with Scouts Canada, Neilson Creative Centre (Etobicoke), King Edward PS, been sponsored by Waterfront Toronto, and supported by Neighbourhood Associations and private and corporate donors.\n\nLast year, I was lead coordinator for one of StreetARToronto’s laneway mural/graffiti projects. It was a wonderful opportunity to mentor my KJ Bit collaborator, June Kim, as a facilitator in the project. This summer, we’ll be coordinating the second phase of this Euclid/Palmerston laneway with a roster of 40 artists and be presenting a WalkShop tour of this laneway for delegates of the National Association of City Transportation Officials. This September, we’ll be painting a mural in partnership with StreetARToronto and TTC at Finch Station. My goal is to continue painting more murals, participating in more laneway jams and creating new, innovative street art events. I’d love to continue working with StreetARToronto because I believe we have mutual respect for the experience and expertise that both sides bring to the table. Above all, I love learning new things, and StreetARToronto has given me a great opportunity to grow as an artist and a facilitator.",

Art continues to form an inner dialogue between viewer and content. The unconscious movement through painting produces a learning experience for audience and artist. Visual elements and aesthetics within one’s control, judged and defined. Allow oneself to interact with the uncontrollable, to embrace the sense of boundless energy.\n\nI would love to share moments and experiences with a community audience to help influence creative growth and community connections using visual art.",

Christopher soon discovered the ink used to date eggs was an interesting medium for painting,  directly influencing his signature splatters and eventually the use of liquid watercolour.

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

For the past 8 years, Jarus has been working with communities across Canada and around the globe to produce large-scale portraits and figures among other images on wall surfaces. They can be found within major cities as well as across rural settings. He has had notable international recognition as a contemporary muralist and figurative painter. He studied briefly at the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto but attributes his knowledge of art to various influences including his grandmother, inspiration from graffiti, and resources found on the internet. The narrative Jarus depicts in his approach communicates a story of individual spirit relevant to the metabolism of that particular neighbourhood. A combination of acrylic, latex and aerosol paint is used to create representations of the people he’s inspired by along his travels. He enjoys painting in public space so that he can understand its context and express it through his work.",

Using tongue in cheek characters and whimsical settings and scenarios I enjoy paying homage to the seemingly mundane and understated. My work can be experienced in a range of formats, such as animations, comics, as well as an array of handmade wearableitems and housewares which I both love to design and craft. My work can also be experienced through my freelance jobs including both indoor and outdoor sign-painting, a large-scale mural at the corner of Peter and Richmond in downtown Toronto in 2016, as well as my past Outside the Box traffic box that I painted at the corner of Brimley and Lawrence in the summer of 2017 which was a wonderful experience.",

        "artist_bio": "My murals play with patterning, painted as if successive layers of wallpaper have been carelessly removed, casually revealing the contrasting elements that lay beneath. Pattern, in the form of repeating decorative motifs, is a ubiquitous form of human expression. Many designs are so distinct they instantly call to mind a particular culture or part of the world. Some repeat over and over again throughout history.\n\nThe motifs that are revealed in my layered murals are from a broad range of eras and cultures. In the tremendously diverse reality of a contemporary globalized world, my paintings are a commentary on the fact that we are all in this together: collaborating, teaching, learning from, and inspiring one another.\n\nI have ten years experience as a working artist, and have created numerous large-scale murals, many with the support of StART. I deeply appreciate the opportunities StART has given me, which have included larger and larger walls, international locations, and a lot of support in troubleshooting the many complexities that arise with mural creation!\n\nMy goals in the future are to move to creating multi-level murals (ie. more than 2 stories tall), to increase the number of assistants I use (thereby increasing mentorship, which I love to do, while decreasing installation time), and to paint more nationally and internationally. I would also love to continue to increase my knowledge of materials, and develop a \"starting a mural\" checklist, with timelines (ie. \"Book Lift - 1 month ahead\", \"Order Paint - 2 weeks ahead\"). I see a lot of big artists painting at festivals, where the timelines are tight, so increasing my speed is another goal for the years ahead.",

        "description": "This design is a playful remix of contemporary design trends popular in Toronto. Inspired by 80s design and dance culture, Art Deco and Pop Art, and contemporary architecture, it plays on motifs seen along Queen street, at underground zine fairs like Canzine and the Toronto Art Book Fair, and at galleries throughout the city. It is a remix of the fun elements and cutting-edge aesthetics that make up contemporary Toronto’s street scenes. The bold geometric shapes hint at the surrounding architecture, while the frenetic patterns emphasize the people and energy of the people in the streets.",

        "artist_bio": "Paula Gonzalez-Ossa is a mural artist who has been working with diverse communities producing street level public art, both in Canada and Latin America for over 25 years. Her ongoing work with StARToronto dates back to 2015. Her murals, like the most recent 500 ft. mural titled \"Our Medicines\"  located at the underpass at Dupont and Shaw, or \"The Ancestral Tree Spirits\" located at the Nordheimer Ravine's TTC station exit, depict a colourful  First Nations cosmovision in relation to the Original lands of Ontario, working closely with Anishnawbe  mentors, Elders and Knowledge Keepers. Gonzalez-Ossa is currently  the Indigenous Education Officer at the AGO’s Weston Learning Centre, as part of the Public Programming and Learning Department, and the Visual Arts instructor and mentoring artist at Na Me Res Sagatay Native Men's Residence. She brings 19 years experience as a  Community Youth Worker with youth at risk in Toronto's West.Some of her previous public works include: a 120 foot mural honoring First Nations from North and South America,  which was the recipient of  the 2014 Ward 27 City Builder’s Award, formerly at Allan Gardens. Other locations sport a ribbon-style mural at Women’s Residence, a women’s shelter at Dundas and Bathurst, in collaborations with an all women crew (2015), and a 4 wall rendition of the Medicine Wheel, inside of Na Me Res Sagatay’s courtyard (2016).  In sharp contrast she produced an indoor mural with 22 students from grades 6-8 at refugee host school Beverley Heights Middle School (2017).She recently served in the capacity of Resident Artist at the Power Plant gallery, developing mural arts programs at two satellite locations with youth from priority neighbouroods in Toronto’s West.(2017-2018). In 2018-2019 she worked closely with the 7Th Generation Image Makers at the Native Youth Resource Centre to mentor, facilitate and produce a mural with an all Indigenous women’s team, located  at the South facing wall at Christie Pits Park’s Alex Duff Memorial Pool. Her two most recent productions  funded by StART’s Partnership Grant in 2019,located at the front façade of Sagatay Naïve Men’s Residence, and the adjacent alley,  depict  “Medicines and Guardians”, as well as “The Wolves Running South”.Last but not least, Gonzalez-Ossa is one of the featured artists at the “You’ve Changed “ exhibit by STARToronto , at St Lawrence Market’s  “Market Gallery”. At the exhibit, the video display shows us her latest short documentary produced  for SART, about the basic protocols entailed when developing images in partnership with Indigenous Nations here in Canada.Gonzalez-Ossa  has been  voted Best Graffiti Artist for the City of Toronto by Now Magazine’s Reader’s Poll in 1997, in 2009, 2010, and 2011. In addition, she has been featured on  CBC (Radio and Television, varying shows), Much Music, MTV, Global Televison, City TV, TVO, CTV, Bell Fibe TV1, Rogers Television, and Telelatino, as well as various television  appearances in Chile, USA (NYC/California), and Jamaica.",

His work explores the juxtaposition of nature with human constructs through explorations into challenging humanities anthropocentric views towards ourselves and our environment. He merges historical approaches to realist and modern art to explore the nature vs culture divide through figures that examine various overlapping themes of anthropocenterism using natural and man made elements and materials.\nTed's work has exhibited in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Steamwhistle Gallery, the RMG, The Station Gallery, Nathan Phillips Square, Bluffs Gallery, the Super Wonder Gallery and his Sculptural Mural Installation is the centerpiece installation of the Aurora Cultural Centre in Aurora Ontario.\n\nIn paint I work with Aerosol and acrylic and Latex. In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

I have been involved in various community-led projects, private and commercial mural commissions. The most impactful projects that I've been apart of, have led me to mentor youth artists and that has been the most rewarding part of those projects. An extension of youth mentorship, I'm also the Artist-in-Residence at Waterfront Neighbourhood Centre. I instruct Room 13, an international Studio that guides a growing network of student-run arts studios in schools and community settings globally. In the past few years, I have been apart of numerous Bell Box Murals Project throughout the city as well as START Outside the Box in 2018.",

In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

        "artist_bio": "I was born after the revolution in Iran. The idea of freedom greatly influenced my whole life not only as an artist but as a human being. I began painting at an art university. My style draws upon elements of traditional Persian painting (Persian Miniatures), the “flatness” and unique composition of which are surprisingly contemporary.\nAfter getting my BFA, I studied Graphic Design at TM university in Tehran. Meanwhile, I started working as a freelance illustrator. Over the past 10 years I have illustrated more than 30 children’s books in Turkey and Iran and all the time I was trying to tell my story with my special language, picture language.\nMy works have been shown in exhibitions and book fairs in Iran, The Emirates, and South Korea but I got inspired by this idea a few years ago which is that the art that we should be doing today in the 21st century should not be just for the museum, it’s art for the street and for people in their daily lives. Also thinking about freedom and social justice in my country lead me to express what I’m feeling through my artworks on street walls so after I answered a call for submissions from Tehran City Hall I started to learn about and experience mural painting.\nSince then, I’ve opened my mind and eyes to observe other mural artists' experiences. After coming to Toronto I’ve found a great number of mural artists and I’ve seen their artworks in the city. Having this great chance to learn from one of them , one of the greatest ones, Nick Sweetman as mentor through a mentorship program by Toronto Ar Council, since then I did some mural projects, trying to improve my skills and techniques an learn more and more. makes me feel so excited and enthusiastic. My style has changed from Miniature to Mural but, like my work as an illustrator, I try to use this medium's potential for telling stories.",

        "artist_bio": "Visual Artist\n\nChristiano De Araujo is a self-taught artist who was born in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. His earliest memory as a child is the moment when he discovered his love of art. As a toddler, he remembers picking up a crayon that his older sister had left behind. When she found that Christiano had taken it, she grabbed it away from him, but in that short amount of time, he had fallen in love with colours and the ability to create.\n\nHis love of art and his talent for the drawing were evident when he was a student in school. His first passion was comics and cartoons and at age 12 he drew his first comic strip.\n\nIn his late teens, Christiano began working for Brazil’s highly circulated newspaper, Diário da Manhã, doing editorial cartoons and illustrations. He also continued to work for other local newspapers and magazines. Realizing that he wanted more opportunities than he could have in Brazil, Christiano chose to immigrate to Canada.\n\nHis first years in Canada were a struggle. Early on, he landed a job as a Bricklayer, which he did for a number of years. Christiano confronted his weaknesses and discovered his strengths, learned to laugh at his hardships, quickly moving on. He was able to overcome any adversities with a determination to succeed and a desire to make himself a better man. This led to his artwork being published in numerous magazines and newspapers in Toronto.\n\nHe also credits his success to a spiritual awakening that he had through meditation and self-hypnosis. It gave him clarity and focus. This experience gave him more confidence and the ability to control his emotions and himself. Christiano devotes much of his life to his art. His endeavours include drawing, oil and acrylic painting, airbrushing, cartooning and sculpting. He is an artist by trade, finds art fun and likes to explore new media and innovated techniques.\n\nChristiano currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He is the founder of Toronto Artists Studio, a studio of visual artists, painters, digital artists and sculptors who design and produce murals and visual communication projects for audiences on a small and grand scale.\n\nAt the present moment, this very moment… Christiano is enjoying the wonderful interaction between the mind and the universe. This infinite universe in which we are all one!",

I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

I work in several disciplines including sculpture (polyurethane resins, concrete, casting techniques), installation art (interactive works that light up, make noise, or move - typically destined for art festivals/events such as Nuit Blanche, Animating Our Waterfront, Hamilton Supercrawl), and painting murals.\n\nMy passion for community arts participation cemented over 15 years ago when I sat on the board of Carfac Ontario as Vice Chair, with Merlin Homer as Chair, a Mohawk Elder whom I consider as a mentor. We had an exceptional team of strong arts leaders and my experience at Carfac helped mould my understanding of fair remuneration, cultural/ethnic/language/gender challenges that artists’ face, and the importance of advocating for one another’s communities.  Profoundly affected by this experience, I’ve continued to work with communities and have co-founded three successful art collectives, Open Field Collective, KJ Bit, and Creativo Collective, whose mandates are to create artwork and murals in public spaces while being inclusive of surrounding communities. In 2017, the Open Field Collective was awarded the national ArtBridges award for “Innovation” in recognition of our dedication to community engagement and our “Street Projects” where we invented miniature art galleries to create and display artwork in public spaces such as residential front yards, King Street (Public Realm), and Guelph. We’ve partnered with Scouts Canada, Neilson Creative Centre (Etobicoke), King Edward PS, been sponsored by Waterfront Toronto, and supported by Neighbourhood Associations and private and corporate donors.\n\nLast year, I was lead coordinator for one of StreetARToronto’s laneway mural/graffiti projects. It was a wonderful opportunity to mentor my KJ Bit collaborator, June Kim, as a facilitator in the project. This summer, we’ll be coordinating the second phase of this Euclid/Palmerston laneway with a roster of 40 artists and be presenting a WalkShop tour of this laneway for delegates of the National Association of City Transportation Officials. This September, we’ll be painting a mural in partnership with StreetARToronto and TTC at Finch Station. My goal is to continue painting more murals, participating in more laneway jams and creating new, innovative street art events. I’d love to continue working with StreetARToronto because I believe we have mutual respect for the experience and expertise that both sides bring to the table. Above all, I love learning new things, and StreetARToronto has given me a great opportunity to grow as an artist and a facilitator.",

I consider each project unique and like to incorporate the surrounding environment, wall structure, and community when developing a mural design and concept. Passing on skills to the next generation of artists is not only beneficial to the community, but myself as well.

In these Institutions, Cote shares his knowledge on the teachings of the Seven Grandfathers, the Medicine Wheel, Pipe, Naming and Sacred Fire Ceremonies, and the History of the Land.\n\nAs an Indigenous painter and Muralist, the purpose of Cote’s research is to unearth, and reveal, his cultural experience and knowledge of signs of Indigenous symbols, language and interpretation.

In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

With StART’s support I want to be mentored in my mural career with any opportunities to connect with seasoned mural/street artists and get on a swing-stage, aerial lift, use a spray gun, while learning to comprehend XL large walls and huge quantities of paint among advanced techniques of execution and project production. I’ve currently reached the stage of painting garages in Toronto and am interested and ready to go larger.\n\nBio & Artist Statement\nAnya Mielniczek is a Toronto based multidisciplinary artist who combines her fine art background with raw material grit in both private and public sectors creating mixed-media installations, mural work and facilitating community art activations.\nThe artists approach to mediums includes latex, aerosol and up-cycled waste, working with the mechanical application of spray and the energy of hand brushed strokes (infused with powerful female portraits and garbage bits if possible).\nA Queen’s University graduate, Anya’s worked with various organizations, municipalities and businesses creating public art within communities around Toronto and internationally. Recent corporate projects include lead production on HideSeek, a 7000sq foot immersive art experience in Toronto and collaborations with BACARDI, QUO Makeup, Moroccanoil, DELL, RBC, 1800GOTJUNK and Chevrolet. Her commitment to her practice especially when aligned with public spaces is to create with purpose by giving nature a voice while defining a conversation with the viewer that may inspire and bring awareness for sustainable change.",

Pattern, in the form of repeating decorative motifs, is a ubiquitous form of human expression. Many designs are so distinct they instantly call to mind a particular culture or part of the world. Some repeat over and over again throughout history.\n\nThe motifs that are revealed in my layered murals are from a broad range of eras and cultures. In the tremendously diverse reality of a contemporary globalized world, my paintings are a commentary on the fact that we are all in this together: collaborating, teaching, learning from, and inspiring one another.\n\nI have ten years experience as a working artist, and have created numerous large-scale murals, many with the support of StART. I deeply appreciate the opportunities StART has given me, which have included larger and larger walls, international locations, and a lot of support in troubleshooting the many complexities that arise with mural creation!\n\nMy goals in the future are to move to creating multi-level murals (ie. more than 2 stories tall), to increase the number of assistants I use (thereby increasing mentorship, which I love to do, while decreasing installation time), and to paint more nationally and internationally. I would also love to continue to increase my knowledge of materials, and develop a \"starting a mural\" checklist, with timelines (ie. \"Book Lift - 1 month ahead\", \"Order Paint - 2 weeks ahead\"). I see a lot of big artists painting at festivals, where the timelines are tight, so increasing my speed is another goal for the years ahead.",

Mirroring life, the Flips Swirl Clusters represent the state of flux that exists in life; a beautiful mess of movement and energy.

Working with StART would allow me these special opportunities.\n\nBio\nJenn Kitagawa is an award-winning multidisciplinary illustrator and artist who grew up in the prairies and cities of Alberta, Canada. She is of Japanese descent and is 4th generation, or Yonsei. She graduated from the MacEwan University and the Alberta College of Art & Design, studying both graphic design and illustration. Shortly after receiving her Bachelors of Design, Jenn moved to New York where she interned for illustrator and artist Mike Perry and for the fashion magazine Nylon.\n\nJenn’s body of work- illustration, gifs, painted murals and installations, engages in a dialogue of openness and curiosity. Her creative explorations are unbounded by medium specificity- they are instead inspired by playfulness, colour, and positivity. She pushes the boundaries between art and design, blurs the lines between tangible and intangible goods and inspires wonder.\n\nJenn has created work for clients ranging from Facebook to Arts & Crafts Records, and had the honour of creating the album artwork for Gord Downie’s record Introduce Yerself. She has previously assisted muralist Kirsten McCrea on a community engaged mural for Telus in Scarborough, painted for the city of Toronto with the StART Project, and last year for Bell Box Mural Projects. She has also painting for the arts market Market Collective in Calgary, leading a community based paint-by-number mural and in May 2019 she painted a large interactive mural.",

He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

        "artist_bio": "Peru is an internationally recognized muralist and graphic artist whose practice is informed by digital and traditional art forms and his 20+ years of painting graffiti. Peru’s professional career started when he moved from Lima to Ottawa at 16; he won every Visual Arts Award in his high school, a Canadian Heritage grant to paint a mural in Vancouver for the International Earth Festival, and a 2 mural commission for the National Capital Commission. At age 20 he moved to Montreal where he continued winning prizes and awards from design contests at his local skateshop to the Millennium Excellence Scholarship.\n\nHis passion for art lead him to rise to the top of the local art scene working for brands and companies such as Bell, Cirque du Soleil and he painted a series of murals with the collective En Masse at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. With En Masse, Peru was part of dozens of collaborative murals throughout Canada, US, Mexico and China, and participated in mentorship programs with the Quebec English School Boards Association. He was also a central muralist for MU since its inception in 2007 and continues to work with them, most recently in 2020 where he will be painting the exterior of a high school.\n\nWhen Peru moved to Toronto a decade later he worked for Urban Outfitters for 5 years as a Lead Display Artist. In this role he built and installed window and store displays participating in store openings across North America including the company’s largest store opening at Herald Square in New York City. Peru used these experiences to expand his skill set and work on art installations at the Osheaga Music Festival as well for American Express for their Live Life Experience Installations around the world; All the while establishing himself as a muralist by assisting, collaborating, and consulting for nearly every arts organization in Toronto, and mentoring individuals, peers and on several occasions’ at-risk youth from the Oasis Skateboard Factory. Peru’s corporate and big brand murals allowed him to balance his work with grass-roots organizations, non-for-profits and BIA’s which make up most of his portfolio. Some of Peru’s corporate clients include Facebook, Nike, Adidas, Corus, Maple Leaf Sports, and Marriott Hotels.",

        "artist_bio": "I'm an Honors OCAD graduate in Fine Arts, a visual artist and community mural painter. My most recent project, The Richmond Hill Traffic Box Murals Project 2019 was made possible through a Richmond Hill Community and Cultural Grant.   I am a StART Concrete Barrier artist and I took part in the Lakeshore Barrier Bike Lane project in 2019. I have created murals for StreeARToronto, The F.H. Varley Art Gallery of Markham and The Toronto Public Library. Last September, I was a muralist for the 2018 StreetARToronto Light up the Laneway Project, (Euclid Palmerston Laneway), and I’ve been accepted three times for StreetARToronto Outside the Box Program.  In 2017 I executed a Canada 150 Bell Box Community Mural Project.  In Toronto, I was hired for the The Coxwell Laneway Mosaic at Coxwell TTC Subway in 2016. Other initiatives include Nuit Blanche and The Henderson CN Bridge Mural,(2014), revisited in January 2020.\nMy ideas are closely tied into Toronto Public Library, where I have worked for over 45 years as a public service worker. My recent positions there have included Children's Programming and Special Collections initiatives, where I have made use of my artistic skills to help community with library projects similar in scope to mural initiatives. Public service includes mural work.  It includes any tools that we can use to help community and helping community through the gifts I can offer has been my life's work.  Truly I believe that there are many avenues available to help needful communities achieve sustainability and gain a sense of pride, both where public spaces are concerned and where housing is concerned.  Mural making is just one of those tools - as are library materials and services, and other community initiatives.\n\nMy goals with StART include partnering the library or offering my librarianship skills to promote and to encourage any initiatives that might be developed by StART, through mural work, to connect the community with literacy in all it's forms, including digital and creative literacy. The way to reach community is to involve them in positive and exciting ways that will give them something of value to add to their lives. Again, there are so many ways we can do this - especially if our important various avenues public service can partner together in creative endeavours to mentor community.\nEvery day at the library or when we are painting murals on walls, we have opportunities to mentor others.  Sometimes this takes on a formal role and sometimes not, but every time we take an interest in a member of our community and show them something they need to know, this is mentoring. Every time we answer a question from a passerby about a project or initiative that has been built to help them - this is mentoring. If possible I would like to take part in a short term or small project mentoring program developed by StART, as I do in the library, with Children's STEM Programming.\n\nAgain, there are many avenues open to mentorship possibilities. I would;d be open to any and all of them, as developed by and at the discretion of StART. I have ideas that would lend themselves to partnership of library and mural making and public consultation for these ideas would include mentorship of community members. iMy most ambitious upcoming project is one I would like to submit next year to the StART Partnership program, to include a large library component to a mural initiative to be developed in central North York near a library.",

Using acrylic and mixed media, these paintings experiment with light, colours, textures and finishes, and many of her pieces can be transformed under a black light, or glow in the dark. Her work has been featured at several juried exhibits and galleries across North America, in product launches, at a food festival, in a permanent collection at a Hilton Hotel in Toronto, in publications, and can be found on the streets of Toronto on 6 traffic boxes.\n\nMy experience painting the START traffic box at Front & John Street was a wonderful collaboration with the public, inviting people of all ages and different nationalities (high tourist traffic) make a small mark on this piece. I'm interested in participating in more street art around Toronto, to help liven our streets, bring energy and positivity to our neighbourhoods and people. Engaging our community in the process, I would love the opportunity to be able to deliver happiness and surprise and delight passers by as I do with my vivid glow in the dark paintings. I welcome the opportunity to work with other more established street artists, to learn more about outdoor art and public engagement, share our skills and techniques and grow together. I would also love to share my love of colour and light with other emerging artists, teaching them about how different materials can be used to create different lighting effects.",

As a result, her current work is devoted to the investigation of whimsical shapes of feminism in today’s world.\n\nI would like to work with StART as I have had wonderful experiences working with you in the past, and I would like to keep this collaboration growing.

I believe communities are stronger when they have a connection to the natural world that exists amidst their neighbourhood. “Knowing your neighbour” is the first step to caring and protecting them.

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

The collection included finger puppets, postcards, trading cards and paper doll sets. As the Political Circus, I did site specific installations about Canadian politics. For example, for Chinatown Remixed (Ottawa 2012), I created a series of portraits of Chinese Canadians in politics that were hung in a Chinese restaurant.

With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

I create images that exist on paper, walls, objects, spaces, and stages. I am interested in using imagery as an opportunity to explore the world, the environment and social issues. I want the public art that I make to be bright and colourful, something that might attract someone's attention as they walk by. I like to create dense images where flat colourful shapes fill the entire wall/object, which can deter graffiti but also can allow for the viewer to notice something new after repeated viewings. In recent projects “Night on the town” or “Canoe with wildlife” (attached below), I tried to connect the imagery to something interesting about the area: the former is a reference to jazz clubs that used to exist in the east side of toronto, and the latter is a tribute the canoe butterfly gardens that can be found in parks throughout the city. I draw people with a looseness in their form, joyously moving and interacting. I would love to be involved with START and create more community engaged art and collaborate with other artists. I am interested in creating images for different spaces and it is a goal of mine to create work in different cities in Canada and internationally.",

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

Using acrylic and mixed media, these paintings experiment with light, colours, textures and finishes, and many of her pieces can be transformed under a black light, or glow in the dark. Her work has been featured at several juried exhibits and galleries across North America, in product launches, at a food festival, in a permanent collection at a Hilton Hotel in Toronto, in publications, and can be found on the streets of Toronto on 6 traffic boxes.\n\nMy experience painting the START traffic box at Front & John Street was a wonderful collaboration with the public, inviting people of all ages and different nationalities (high tourist traffic) make a small mark on this piece. I'm interested in participating in more street art around Toronto, to help liven our streets, bring energy and positivity to our neighbourhoods and people. Engaging our community in the process, I would love the opportunity to be able to deliver happiness and surprise and delight passers by as I do with my vivid glow in the dark paintings. I welcome the opportunity to work with other more established street artists, to learn more about outdoor art and public engagement, share our skills and techniques and grow together. I would also love to share my love of colour and light with other emerging artists, teaching them about how different materials can be used to create different lighting effects.",

Art making has been a life affirming escape and a way to process his surroundings. OCAD opened his eyes to different approaches and techniques. Focusing on the dissection of colour and light into geometric shapes and patterns, Jason's artwork creates a juxtaposition between the abstract and the representational. This style lends well to a mural site and its organic blend into the community. Thinking critically about the transformation of public spaces, Jason looks for interesting ways to use colour, form, and shape to create visual landmarks to promote and evolve the aesthetic narrative of the city.\n\nMost recently, his commercial commissions include: Yonge + Dundas Square Toronto Musician series, Fet Zun restaurant exterior signage, Ubisoft Assasin's Creed Fan Mural, and, MLB Blue Jays temporary mural at Union Station.",

Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

These projects have become meaningful and rewarding experiences for me as I got a chance to share my narrative with my community, alter spaces and engage public. I’ve participated in collaborative murals with Mural Routes and Artbarn School. I have also completed my own projects as a lead artist in a cafe, Art Fair and Public School.

My mural career includes works for private, commercial, corporate clients, educational institutions and public art projects. One highlight of my career was working with acclaimed American artist Frank Stella as the Studio Manager for his studios in Toronto, New York and Houston, Texas. During this time the studio created large scale mixed media murals based on Mr. Stella’s paper collages.\nThese works were commissioned by international galleries and museums from Japan to Germany and included Torontoʼs Princess of Wales Theatre.\n\nI have worked with the StART team on several large scale projects and I have always been impressed with all of the support and encouragement that this program cultivates.  From the beginning, it was apparent how much the program focuses on bringing together artists and communities to create a lasting positive experience for all.  During the production of both my Park Lawn Underpass Mural and the Lake Shore Cycle Track Barrier Murals, I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback and response from the individuals driving, biking, riding and walking by these public pieces of art.  So much of an artists' time is spent creating a piece of artwork alone in the studio.  The StART program allows for an \"on the spot\" engagement with the community during the development of a mural.  For me, this is the most rewarding part of these murals.  I am proud to bring my artistic vision to these public works of art through the StART program for all to enjoy no matter what their background, social status or familiarity with a traditional gallery/museum setting.",

After obtaining my Bachelor’s degree, I began working as a Visual Communications Coordinator at a large corporation. After 7 years, I decided to pursue my own art and design practice. I have since been awarded and published a number of times, had a solo exhibition and have created a number of murals around Toronto. I create colourful and whimsical paintings, digital art and GIFs that focus on life as a woman, spirituality and everyday life. I’m a shameless coffee addict and frequent the local cafes. Dancing, yoga and biking are my preferred ways of recharging.\nI started my street art work since 2018 at which point I painted on a utility box for StreetARToronto and since then I have painted multiple small scale murals around Toronto for StreetART, Bell Box Murals including garage doors and concrete walls. I would like to continue expanding my street art practice and beautify the city further.",

        "artist_bio": "I am a Toronto-based illustrator, muralist and comics artist working out of a studio space on Dupont that I share with other 3 artists. While a lot of my illustration work is done for editorial or corporate clients, I’ve also had the opportunity to work on some community-based and public artwork projects over the past 2 years that I’ve been especially excited about. Through involvement with StART, I would love to find out about more opportunities to create public mural art that lives in and complements the community it is a part of. I think art in the public realm is so interesting to me because of how impactful it can be on mundane life – a visual break in the expected city patterns of shopfront, garage door, lamppost, parking meter. Even an escape. Themes of the idiosyncratic in the ordinary, the dichotomy between real and imagined, are things that my own work is interested in exploring, along with a sense of whimsy and play.\n\nDuring the past few summers, I’ve been able to work on the Outside the Box traffic signal mural project, Womxn Paint in Toronto and in Rexdale, and the Lightup Laneway project. The outdoor murals I’ve completed have used a combination of exterior latex paint and spray paint, and in the future I’d like to explore more of how these mediums can work together, as well as improve on my ability to use spray paint which I was introduced to through Womxn Paint. Through public hoarding projects with PATCH (Mississauga and Region of Peel Watermain hoarding near Celebration Square; Bay Adelaide hoarding) I also have experience producing digital images for large-scale digital printing.\n\nThis upcoming year, I hope to have more opportunities to learn about making public artwork that supports the community it is a part of. I also want to challenge myself to work on larger, more varied projects that offer the opportunity for diversity in imagery and representation. I want to try new painting techniques with elements such as gradients and textures, and involve spray painting more in my mural work. I’m also interested in obtaining heights certification so that I’m able to work on larger walls should the opportunity arise. And I’d like to think about how – in mural making as in other life practises – I can do so with greater attention to sustainable practises and to the impact of what I’m doing. In general, I’d love increased opportunities to help make the site I’m painting in both reflective of and interesting to the imaginations of those who live here.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

I have a particular interest in supporting the art experience of families and children, and I carry my creativity and desire to connect through to my teaching practice. I have experience managing, curating, and instructing Art and Art History lessons at various schools and art studios in the GTA. I have taught art curriculums for school aged children, as well as individual workshops for all ages and groups, and I teach English as a foreign language.\n\nMy projects vary, but I am always thrilled by new possibilities, forever thinking of ways to apply myself. My illustrations are often concerned with the quality of a moment - perhaps the mystery of an unknown figure or the delight of a nostalgic object. Use of soft colours, gentle line art, and figurative subject matter has often been a characteristic of my work. The projects and materials I engage with may vary greatly, as I am always open to new inspirations and chances to grow.\n\nI hope to always be conscious of the potential my work has to inspire, represent, and encourage — particularly with young viewers. Art has a profound impact on our every days lives — it builds character, opens minds, and forges relationships. My ardent desire to contribute to the street art scene is rooted in my conviction that art is for everyone. I am profoundly grateful to those artists who transform the city (and my experience of it) with their work. As a creator, I feel I must remain aware of how I can make artwork more accessible, in part by bringing my illustrations to the streets.\n\nPrograms like StART create a vital link between artists and communities. While I am motivated to make my artwork more accessible to the public, StART makes my goals as an artist more viable when too often I am inhibited by the financial barriers of creating and distributing art independently. I am deeply appreciative of this program and I am invigorated as an artist by the opportunities StART offers each year to learn and to share.",

He is best known for his colourful works lining the alleys and streets of Toronto and achieved international recognition.  Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto., I bring it every time, got a good track record of big colour and positive results.",

        "artist_bio": "My murals play with patterning, painted as if successive layers of wallpaper have been carelessly removed, casually revealing the contrasting elements that lay beneath. Pattern, in the form of repeating decorative motifs, is a ubiquitous form of human expression. Many designs are so distinct they instantly call to mind a particular culture or part of the world. Some repeat over and over again throughout history.\n\nThe motifs that are revealed in my layered murals are from a broad range of eras and cultures. In the tremendously diverse reality of a contemporary globalized world, my paintings are a commentary on the fact that we are all in this together: collaborating, teaching, learning from, and inspiring one another.\n\nI have ten years experience as a working artist, and have created numerous large-scale murals, many with the support of StART. I deeply appreciate the opportunities StART has given me, which have included larger and larger walls, international locations, and a lot of support in troubleshooting the many complexities that arise with mural creation!\n\nMy goals in the future are to move to creating multi-level murals (ie. more than 2 stories tall), to increase the number of assistants I use (thereby increasing mentorship, which I love to do, while decreasing installation time), and to paint more nationally and internationally. I would also love to continue to increase my knowledge of materials, and develop a \"starting a mural\" checklist, with timelines (ie. \"Book Lift - 1 month ahead\", \"Order Paint - 2 weeks ahead\"). I see a lot of big artists painting at festivals, where the timelines are tight, so increasing my speed is another goal for the years ahead.",

Using acrylic and mixed media, these paintings experiment with light, colours, textures and finishes, and many of her pieces can be transformed under a black light, or glow in the dark. Her work has been featured at several juried exhibits and galleries across North America, in product launches, at a food festival, in a permanent collection at a Hilton Hotel in Toronto, in publications, and can be found on the streets of Toronto on 6 traffic boxes.\n\nMy experience painting the START traffic box at Front & John Street was a wonderful collaboration with the public, inviting people of all ages and different nationalities (high tourist traffic) make a small mark on this piece. I'm interested in participating in more street art around Toronto, to help liven our streets, bring energy and positivity to our neighbourhoods and people. Engaging our community in the process, I would love the opportunity to be able to deliver happiness and surprise and delight passers by as I do with my vivid glow in the dark paintings. I welcome the opportunity to work with other more established street artists, to learn more about outdoor art and public engagement, share our skills and techniques and grow together. I would also love to share my love of colour and light with other emerging artists, teaching them about how different materials can be used to create different lighting effects.",

I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

However, recently I've been getting more into creating murals for commercials spaces (with spray paint and house paint) and would really love to participate and learn more from StrART projects and how the organization beautifies the city. Generally, my work is influenced by how colours and how they shape a subject can express universal stories or emotions especially applying them on portraits to elaborate on the subject's nuanced story/mood. Since my work is essentially influenced by formless colours and emotions, my process basically involves trying to form or incorporate these colours/shapes into the subject I'm reinterpreting into my style. My overall goal for getting involved with StART is to essentially learn and challenge myself in new ways to express that colourful vision.",

Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

Though I shift between styles, one strong commonality in my work is the intent to stimulate human curiosity by negating the familiar, and twisting notions or ideas perceived by society.\nGrowing up in Japan until age 20, I’ve always been drawn to the vintage photography, religious imagery, and advertising of Americana. It was only for personal enjoyment when I first began collecting such imageries, yet soon I developed one of my recurring techniques: photo collage. Combining what at first seems contradictory, my photo collages are a sensational and compositional fusion of found items as a way to access the unconscious mind.\n\nIn parallel with photo collages, I am focused on making artworks with intense simplistic forms and bold blocks of colour, and by forgoing visual details. This is because I’m nearly blind without the help of glasses, which makes seeing the details of the world secondary.\nSuch poor eyesight, always making collages: cutting shapes and pasting them, all that attest to the very process I perceive and compose.\nI tantalize the boundaries between abstraction and representation of a familiar object or a scene, inviting viewers to insinuate a new meaning without lingering to past knowledge or future thought.",

I paint indoor and outdoor murals with themes such as local wildlife and climate change in effort to educate and celebrate the beauty and importance of local ecosystems. I believe communities are stronger when they have a connection to the natural world that exists amidst their neighbourhood. “Knowing your neighbour” is the first step to caring and protecting them. This stewardship brings communities together. I hope to work with stART to celebrate local communities of Toronto –including the people, plants and animals.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

He is best known for his colourful works lining the alleys and streets of Toronto and achieved international recognition.  Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto.",

Though I shift between styles, one strong commonality in my work is the intent to stimulate human curiosity by negating the familiar, and twisting notions or ideas perceived by society.\nGrowing up in Japan until age 20, I’ve always been drawn to the vintage photography, religious imagery, and advertising of Americana. It was only for personal enjoyment when I first began collecting such imageries, yet soon I developed one of my recurring techniques: photo collage. Combining what at first seems contradictory, my photo collages are a sensational and compositional fusion of found items as a way to access the unconscious mind.\n\nIn parallel with photo collages, I am focused on making artworks with intense simplistic forms and bold blocks of colour, and by forgoing visual details. This is because I’m nearly blind without the help of glasses, which makes seeing the details of the world secondary.\nSuch poor eyesight, always making collages: cutting shapes and pasting them, all that attest to the very process I perceive and compose.\nI tantalize the boundaries between abstraction and representation of a familiar object or a scene, inviting viewers to insinuate a new meaning without lingering to past knowledge or future thought.",

He is best known for his colourful works lining the alleys and streets of Toronto and achieved international recognition.  Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto.",

I created a painting for the 2018 'Outside the Box' programme, and would like to become more involved in public art in Toronto.\n\nPublic art themes I am interested in exploring involve (re)connecting with nature, in particular the sky – the Moon, the Sun, the planets and stars, and the seasonal rhythms throughout the year. As a trained astronomer, I feel a strong connection to the celestial, and my work deals with the essential interconnected nature of humans and the Universe. I feel that in our urban environment, we have lost many elements of our relationship with nature. I would propose artwork which would kindle a reconnection and help deepen awareness of our place in the local landscape, and in the wider Universe as a whole. With the diversity of our backgrounds - our origins, our orientations, our outlooks -  we all experience one sky. Connecting with nature is a fundamental aspect of the universal human experience, and given the stresses and distractions of our digital and built environments, is something we all need to be attentive to, and cultivate.\n\nI have a strong interest in colour and feel that the use of colour in public art is key as it is uplifting and inspires joy – crucial elements for art in the public realm. Although my training and practice lies in painting, I also have a desire to extend my practice into sculpture; in particular, public artworks which mark seasonal changes in the sky. One goal is to create artwork which makes people look up.\n\nI am also interested in becoming more involved in the community and facilitating workshops (with all ages) which explore interconnections between science and art, and using the artmaking process as a way of deepening our understanding of nature. I have facilitated workshops in the past, and currently teach at York University in the Faculty of Science's Division of Natural Science. I also am a member of Propeller Gallery.\n\nFor me, the opportunity to make public art represents a natural extension and culmination point for my backgrounds in art, science and education. I seek wider opportunities to engage the public, both visually and conceptually, as well as including them in the artmaking process.\n\nI would be interested in participating in any of the StART programmes, and would be happy to work as a team member in larger scale projects on other artists' designs.",

As an immigrant artist she often explores the concept of “home”, and the sense of wistful longing and nostalgia that it brings out in her work.\nHer childhood experience became a strong incentive for her to make illustrations that depict women as beautiful, empowered, and strong. As a result, her current work is devoted to the investigation of whimsical shapes of feminism in today’s world.\n\nI would like to work with StART as I have had wonderful experiences working with you in the past, and I would like to keep this collaboration growing. You allow me to express myself, educate people, and beautify Toronto with my skills and ideas.",

I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

I have witnessed many changes and struggles in neighborhoods throughout the city and have contributed to developing community strength through several art projects.\nI choose to create art that can be seen and appreciated by the public, free and accessible to anyone - bringing beauty to dingy, neglected areas of town. I enjoy working with communities to engage them in the process of change, establish personal connections and develop a sense of pride in their neighborhood.\nMy goal is to work on a larger scale projects with StART. I would like to be mentored/assisted in the use of aerosol painting as well as high murals requiring a lift. Working with StART, I would love to work with an Indigenous artist/group on a co-operative project to learn, exchange information and cultural practices. Indigenous art including Woodland style, Inuit sculpture, drawing and printmaking, are my favourite styles of art.\nMy artwork also addresses environmental concerns/issues; reminding us that everything has a purpose, even when it is not clear to us, what that is. I often find inspiration in ecology, the environment and site-specific surroundings the mural will be in. Figures, the body, and movement are recurring themes in my art.\nAs well as being a painter, I have been a professional photographer for over 25 years, creating images digitally as well as on film. Previously, I was the Resident Photography Artist at Mississauga Living Art Centre. While working at the TDSB, I was honoured to photograph Nelson Mandela on his first visit to Toronto. I collaborated with teachers and students on several art projects including a handmade book given to Mr. Mandela.\nI am experienced in photographing events, fine art documentation, portraits, dance and theatre, products, buildings, magazine and commercial work. I also create digital designs including Op Art, tile patterns, floral, abstract; web design, preparing/repurposing images for web, email and print.\nMaterials and mediums I work with include photography, acrylic and latex paint, acrylic markers, aerosol paint, clay, wood and collage.\n\nI have graduated from 3 art programs: Central Technical School Adult Art Program, Ryerson Still Photography and Humber College Audio/Visual Technology. As a multidisciplinary artist, my unique combination of art and technology skills brings strength of understanding to all my projects. Working as a full-time artist and art educator, I teach painting, drawing, ceramics, mixed media and photography throughout the GTA, to seniors, adults and children.",

        "artist_bio": "I'm an Honors OCAD graduate in Fine Arts, a visual artist and community mural painter. My most recent project, The Richmond Hill Traffic Box Murals Project 2019 was made possible through a Richmond Hill Community and Cultural Grant.   I am a StART Concrete Barrier artist and I took part in the Lakeshore Barrier Bike Lane project in 2019. I have created murals for StreeARToronto, The F.H. Varley Art Gallery of Markham and The Toronto Public Library. Last September, I was a muralist for the 2018 StreetARToronto Light up the Laneway Project, (Euclid Palmerston Laneway), and I’ve been accepted three times for StreetARToronto Outside the Box Program.  In 2017 I executed a Canada 150 Bell Box Community Mural Project.  In Toronto, I was hired for the The Coxwell Laneway Mosaic at Coxwell TTC Subway in 2016. Other initiatives include Nuit Blanche and The Henderson CN Bridge Mural,(2014), revisited in January 2020.\nMy ideas are closely tied into Toronto Public Library, where I have worked for over 45 years as a public service worker. My recent positions there have included Children's Programming and Special Collections initiatives, where I have made use of my artistic skills to help community with library projects similar in scope to mural initiatives. Public service includes mural work.  It includes any tools that we can use to help community and helping community through the gifts I can offer has been my life's work.  Truly I believe that there are many avenues available to help needful communities achieve sustainability and gain a sense of pride, both where public spaces are concerned and where housing is concerned.  Mural making is just one of those tools - as are library materials and services, and other community initiatives.\n\nMy goals with StART include partnering the library or offering my librarianship skills to promote and to encourage any initiatives that might be developed by StART, through mural work, to connect the community with literacy in all it's forms, including digital and creative literacy. The way to reach community is to involve them in positive and exciting ways that will give them something of value to add to their lives. Again, there are so many ways we can do this - especially if our important various avenues public service can partner together in creative endeavours to mentor community.\nEvery day at the library or when we are painting murals on walls, we have opportunities to mentor others.  Sometimes this takes on a formal role and sometimes not, but every time we take an interest in a member of our community and show them something they need to know, this is mentoring. Every time we answer a question from a passerby about a project or initiative that has been built to help them - this is mentoring. If possible I would like to take part in a short term or small project mentoring program developed by StART, as I do in the library, with Children's STEM Programming.\n\nAgain, there are many avenues open to mentorship possibilities. I would;d be open to any and all of them, as developed by and at the discretion of StART. I have ideas that would lend themselves to partnership of library and mural making and public consultation for these ideas would include mentorship of community members. iMy most ambitious upcoming project is one I would like to submit next year to the StART Partnership program, to include a large library component to a mural initiative to be developed in central North York near a library.",

My mural career includes works for private, commercial, corporate clients, educational institutions and public art projects. One highlight of my career was working with acclaimed American artist Frank Stella as the Studio Manager for his studios in Toronto, New York and Houston, Texas. During this time the studio created large scale mixed media murals based on Mr. Stella’s paper collages.\nThese works were commissioned by international galleries and museums from Japan to Germany and included Torontoʼs Princess of Wales Theatre.\n\nI have worked with the StART team on several large scale projects and I have always been impressed with all of the support and encouragement that this program cultivates.  From the beginning, it was apparent how much the program focuses on bringing together artists and communities to create a lasting positive experience for all.  During the production of both my Park Lawn Underpass Mural and the Lake Shore Cycle Track Barrier Murals, I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback and response from the individuals driving, biking, riding and walking by these public pieces of art.  So much of an artists' time is spent creating a piece of artwork alone in the studio.  The StART program allows for an \"on the spot\" engagement with the community during the development of a mural.  For me, this is the most rewarding part of these murals.  I am proud to bring my artistic vision to these public works of art through the StART program for all to enjoy no matter what their background, social status or familiarity with a traditional gallery/museum setting.",

        "artist_bio": "Visual Artist\n\nChristiano De Araujo is a self-taught artist who was born in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. His earliest memory as a child is the moment when he discovered his love of art. As a toddler, he remembers picking up a crayon that his older sister had left behind. When she found that Christiano had taken it, she grabbed it away from him, but in that short amount of time, he had fallen in love with colours and the ability to create.\n\nHis love of art and his talent for the drawing were evident when he was a student in school. His first passion was comics and cartoons and at age 12 he drew his first comic strip.\n\nIn his late teens, Christiano began working for Brazil’s highly circulated newspaper, Diário da Manhã, doing editorial cartoons and illustrations. He also continued to work for other local newspapers and magazines. Realizing that he wanted more opportunities than he could have in Brazil, Christiano chose to immigrate to Canada.\n\nHis first years in Canada were a struggle. Early on, he landed a job as a Bricklayer, which he did for a number of years. Christiano confronted his weaknesses and discovered his strengths, learned to laugh at his hardships, quickly moving on. He was able to overcome any adversities with a determination to succeed and a desire to make himself a better man. This led to his artwork being published in numerous magazines and newspapers in Toronto.\n\nHe also credits his success to a spiritual awakening that he had through meditation and self-hypnosis. It gave him clarity and focus. This experience gave him more confidence and the ability to control his emotions and himself. Christiano devotes much of his life to his art. His endeavours include drawing, oil and acrylic painting, airbrushing, cartooning and sculpting. He is an artist by trade, finds art fun and likes to explore new media and innovated techniques.\n\nChristiano currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He is the founder of Toronto Artists Studio, a studio of visual artists, painters, digital artists and sculptors who design and produce murals and visual communication projects for audiences on a small and grand scale.\n\nAt the present moment, this very moment… Christiano is enjoying the wonderful interaction between the mind and the universe. This infinite universe in which we are all one!",

I have since been awarded and published a number of times, had a solo exhibition and have created a number of murals around Toronto. I create colourful and whimsical paintings, digital art and GIFs that focus on life as a woman, spirituality and everyday life. I’m a shameless coffee addict and frequent the local cafes. Dancing, yoga and biking are my preferred ways of recharging.\nI started my street art work since 2018 at which point I painted on a utility box for StreetARToronto and since then I have painted multiple small scale murals around Toronto for StreetART, Bell Box Murals including garage doors and concrete walls.

I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

        "artist_bio": "I’d love to work with StreetARToronto because I’m inspired by the artistic legacy they are building in the City of Toronto. StART’s vision to create beautiful and safer public spaces with a mandate to act inclusively, celebrate our strengths in diversity, to acknowledge and respect the cultures and lands of Indigenous persons, and mentor emerging talents, all reflect my own values in my professional and personal life.\n\nI’ve been an artist for 20 years in the public realm, having exhibited in public art galleries, artist-run centres, art festivals, and having worked with public/private planning teams to create permanent public art with budgets up to $56,000.00 (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital). I work in several disciplines including sculpture (polyurethane resins, concrete, casting techniques), installation art (interactive works that light up, make noise, or move - typically destined for art festivals/events such as Nuit Blanche, Animating Our Waterfront, Hamilton Supercrawl), and painting murals.\n\nMy passion for community arts participation cemented over 15 years ago when I sat on the board of Carfac Ontario as Vice Chair, with Merlin Homer as Chair, a Mohawk Elder whom I consider as a mentor. We had an exceptional team of strong arts leaders and my experience at Carfac helped mould my understanding of fair remuneration, cultural/ethnic/language/gender challenges that artists’ face, and the importance of advocating for one another’s communities.  Profoundly affected by this experience, I’ve continued to work with communities and have co-founded three successful art collectives, Open Field Collective, KJ Bit, and Creativo Collective, whose mandates are to create artwork and murals in public spaces while being inclusive of surrounding communities. In 2017, the Open Field Collective was awarded the national ArtBridges award for “Innovation” in recognition of our dedication to community engagement and our “Street Projects” where we invented miniature art galleries to create and display artwork in public spaces such as residential front yards, King Street (Public Realm), and Guelph. We’ve partnered with Scouts Canada, Neilson Creative Centre (Etobicoke), King Edward PS, been sponsored by Waterfront Toronto, and supported by Neighbourhood Associations and private and corporate donors.\n\nLast year, I was lead coordinator for one of StreetARToronto’s laneway mural/graffiti projects. It was a wonderful opportunity to mentor my KJ Bit collaborator, June Kim, as a facilitator in the project. This summer, we’ll be coordinating the second phase of this Euclid/Palmerston laneway with a roster of 40 artists and be presenting a WalkShop tour of this laneway for delegates of the National Association of City Transportation Officials. This September, we’ll be painting a mural in partnership with StreetARToronto and TTC at Finch Station. My goal is to continue painting more murals, participating in more laneway jams and creating new, innovative street art events. I’d love to continue working with StreetARToronto because I believe we have mutual respect for the experience and expertise that both sides bring to the table. Above all, I love learning new things, and StreetARToronto has given me a great opportunity to grow as an artist and a facilitator.",

With StART’s support I want to be mentored in my mural career with any opportunities to connect with seasoned mural/street artists and get on a swing-stage, aerial lift, use a spray gun, while learning to comprehend XL large walls and huge quantities of paint among advanced techniques of execution and project production. I’ve currently reached the stage of painting garages in Toronto and am interested and ready to go larger.\n\nBio & Artist Statement\nAnya Mielniczek is a Toronto based multidisciplinary artist who combines her fine art background with raw material grit in both private and public sectors creating mixed-media installations, mural work and facilitating community art activations.\nThe artists approach to mediums includes latex, aerosol and up-cycled waste, working with the mechanical application of spray and the energy of hand brushed strokes (infused with powerful female portraits and garbage bits if possible).\nA Queen’s University graduate, Anya’s worked with various organizations, municipalities and businesses creating public art within communities around Toronto and internationally. Recent corporate projects include lead production on HideSeek, a 7000sq foot immersive art experience in Toronto and collaborations with BACARDI, QUO Makeup, Moroccanoil, DELL, RBC, 1800GOTJUNK and Chevrolet. Her commitment to her practice especially when aligned with public spaces is to create with purpose by giving nature a voice while defining a conversation with the viewer that may inspire and bring awareness for sustainable change.",

I utilize a lot of different mediums into my art practice such as oils, acrylics, watercolour, ink, graphite, spray paint and exterior latex paint. I have been involved in various community-led projects, private and commercial mural commissions. The most impactful projects that I've been apart of, have led me to mentor youth artists and that has been the most rewarding part of those projects. An extension of youth mentorship, I'm also the Artist-in-Residence at Waterfront Neighbourhood Centre. I instruct Room 13, an international Studio that guides a growing network of student-run arts studios in schools and community settings globally. In the past few years, I have been apart of numerous Bell Box Murals Project throughout the city as well as START Outside the Box in 2018.",

The rich and vibrant cultures of the places I’ve visited have been my main inspiration to create and share my artistic vision with others. As a Canadian-Colombian artist is empowering for me to paint around the themes of culture, nature, and identity enriching Canadian multiculturalism. Most of my murals are found in Canada and Colombia, my wish is to continue painting across Canada and the world.",

Spray Paint.\n\nThe exploration of self-dialogue with material and atmosphere, grants moments of incidental and intentional aesthetics.

Visual elements and aesthetics within one’s control, judged and defined. Allow oneself to interact with the uncontrollable, to embrace the sense of boundless energy.\n\nI would love to share moments and experiences with a community audience to help influence creative growth and community connections using visual art.",

Though I shift between styles, one strong commonality in my work is the intent to stimulate human curiosity by negating the familiar, and twisting notions or ideas perceived by society.\nGrowing up in Japan until age 20, I’ve always been drawn to the vintage photography, religious imagery, and advertising of Americana. It was only for personal enjoyment when I first began collecting such imageries, yet soon I developed one of my recurring techniques: photo collage. Combining what at first seems contradictory, my photo collages are a sensational and compositional fusion of found items as a way to access the unconscious mind.\n\nIn parallel with photo collages, I am focused on making artworks with intense simplistic forms and bold blocks of colour, and by forgoing visual details. This is because I’m nearly blind without the help of glasses, which makes seeing the details of the world secondary.\nSuch poor eyesight, always making collages: cutting shapes and pasting them, all that attest to the very process I perceive and compose.\nI tantalize the boundaries between abstraction and representation of a familiar object or a scene, inviting viewers to insinuate a new meaning without lingering to past knowledge or future thought.",

Majority of my paintings revolve around relationship between figure and abstract space, as I tend to explore themes of personal identity, duality and shifting perceptions.In the past two years I have been working in public spaces painting murals. These projects have become meaningful and rewarding experiences for me as I got a chance to share my narrative with my community, alter spaces and engage public. I’ve participated in collaborative murals with Mural Routes and Artbarn School. I have also completed my own projects as a lead artist in a cafe, Art Fair and Public School. Last summer I was thrilled to participate in the StART OTB program and Bellbox Mural programs.",

Drawing came easy to me but I had to work hard to be a good painter - I’m still working. Painting for me is a process of meditation; it’s a constant pursuit to describe the mental landscape as influenced by its surroundings.\n\tAs well as painting, I work as a photographer, shooting everything from events, editorials, and sometimes celebrities. My grandfather was an avid amateur photographer and gave me my first camera at a young age. Photography and painting have always gone hand in hand for me. One feeds the other. Photography as a tool has been employed by painters and artists since its invention. One could make a strong case that the advent of photography could not have been achieved without the help of painting and classical tools such as the camera obscura to help painters recreate scenes. I use photography in this way, creating images from reference subjects I capture.\n\tMy work is an ongoing process. I try not to just do one thing, I don’t think standing still and producing one product time and time again is a good thing. An artist has to be careful to not let their work become stale.\n \t1950s abstract expressionism is my jam. The New York school was a big influence on me as a young artist, but also the Montreal scene. The artist Jean-Paul Riopelle and Paul Emile Borduas were heroes of mine. Leader of the Automatistes and main author of the manifesto Refus Global, Borduas broke from all convention. I remember vividly seeing L’étoile Noir in person when I was young and being blown away by its bold simplicity. The surrealists also had a profound impact on my practice - specifically Dali for his character and brashness. His ambitious paintings and tight style always impressed  and humbled me.  H.R. Giger and Francis Bacon are also worth mentioning. Both artists’ approaches to painting were violent, sexual, and graphic. Food for the young artist.\n\tThe world is too interesting to not reflect on. The sublime and terrifying are always in front of us and we often have to ignore them to get on with our day. I like to allow my paintings to shape themselves in my mind. The painting comes to life on its own, almost independently of the creator. That’s often where the satisfaction comes from - surpassing your expectations and vision. The opposite is also true, and depressing. The failed painting can often take weeks or months to get over.",

I create images that exist on paper, walls, objects, spaces, and stages. I am interested in using imagery as an opportunity to explore the world, the environment and social issues. I want the public art that I make to be bright and colourful, something that might attract someone's attention as they walk by. I like to create dense images where flat colourful shapes fill the entire wall/object, which can deter graffiti but also can allow for the viewer to notice something new after repeated viewings. In recent projects “Night on the town” or “Canoe with wildlife” (attached below), I tried to connect the imagery to something interesting about the area: the former is a reference to jazz clubs that used to exist in the east side of toronto, and the latter is a tribute the canoe butterfly gardens that can be found in parks throughout the city. I draw people with a looseness in their form, joyously moving and interacting. I would love to be involved with START and create more community engaged art and collaborate with other artists. I am interested in creating images for different spaces and it is a goal of mine to create work in different cities in Canada and internationally.",

Her unique art works are mainly influenced by nature.\nStriving to create work that is distinctive, engaging and above all, memorable, she conveys a story or invokes a certain emotion in each of her works. She believes art is one of the purest forms of communication. In addition to painting and design she contributes to public and street art as well. Her goal is to be more engaged in beautifying city and involving in the community.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nI’m passionate about creativity. When I start to create a piece of art, my mind and body become united and empowered in the process of making! Nature is my inspiration. Usually I spend some time in nature , taking some photos ( I do professional photography as well) and I try to incorporate what I see in my paintings but not in a realistic way. I get inspired by forms, colours or even sounds. I transfer my feeling and emotion into the painting surface; It’s my way of story telling.\n\nI would like to be involved with StART because with my background in creativity and art, I see myself growing in public art and I want to put any effort to be engage in communities. I love to do art for people and see them enjoy their environments. In my opinion, Art is communication; it allows people from different cultures and different times to communicate with each other via images, sounds and stories. My responsibility as an artist is to be engage in my society and help people to get more connected with each other and their environment.\nI want to do bigger projects and experience different platforms.

I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

The rich and vibrant cultures of the places I’ve visited have been my main inspiration to create and share my artistic vision with others. As a Canadian-Colombian artist is empowering for me to paint around the themes of culture, nature, and identity enriching Canadian multiculturalism. Most of my murals are found in Canada and Colombia, my wish is to continue painting across Canada and the world.",

I have witnessed many changes and struggles in neighborhoods throughout the city and have contributed to developing community strength through several art projects.\nI choose to create art that can be seen and appreciated by the public, free and accessible to anyone - bringing beauty to dingy, neglected areas of town. I enjoy working with communities to engage them in the process of change, establish personal connections and develop a sense of pride in their neighborhood.\nMy goal is to work on a larger scale projects with StART. I would like to be mentored/assisted in the use of aerosol painting as well as high murals requiring a lift. Working with StART, I would love to work with an Indigenous artist/group on a co-operative project to learn, exchange information and cultural practices. Indigenous art including Woodland style, Inuit sculpture, drawing and printmaking, are my favourite styles of art.\nMy artwork also addresses environmental concerns/issues; reminding us that everything has a purpose, even when it is not clear to us, what that is. I often find inspiration in ecology, the environment and site-specific surroundings the mural will be in. Figures, the body, and movement are recurring themes in my art.\nAs well as being a painter, I have been a professional photographer for over 25 years, creating images digitally as well as on film. Previously, I was the Resident Photography Artist at Mississauga Living Art Centre. While working at the TDSB, I was honoured to photograph Nelson Mandela on his first visit to Toronto. I collaborated with teachers and students on several art projects including a handmade book given to Mr. Mandela.\nI am experienced in photographing events, fine art documentation, portraits, dance and theatre, products, buildings, magazine and commercial work. I also create digital designs including Op Art, tile patterns, floral, abstract; web design, preparing/repurposing images for web, email and print.\nMaterials and mediums I work with include photography, acrylic and latex paint, acrylic markers, aerosol paint, clay, wood and collage.\n\nI have graduated from 3 art programs: Central Technical School Adult Art Program, Ryerson Still Photography and Humber College Audio/Visual Technology. As a multidisciplinary artist, my unique combination of art and technology skills brings strength of understanding to all my projects. Working as a full-time artist and art educator, I teach painting, drawing, ceramics, mixed media and photography throughout the GTA, to seniors, adults and children.",

I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences from which to draw inspiration; a love of creativity in all its forms; a love of culture and the similarities/differences between us all, which makes this world so beautiful.I am inspired by pen & ink fairy tale illustrations, the female form & nature motifs of art nouveau and art deco, the connection of spirit between us and nature of indigenous art, the images/icons/emblems of indigenous culture, and depicting my emotions relating to family/history/current affairs. My favourite medium is dipped pen and ink, especially blue ink: blue like at twilight a time of transition, blue like the water which is women's privilege to cherish and protect.\n    I am known for my blue dipped pen & ink drawings which incorporate science, history, current affairs, empathy and\ngracefulness with beautiful female figures in my unique style I call N8V (native) Nouveau. In the past couple of years, I have painted 7 murals ranging in size from 5' x 8' up to 19' x 50'. One of these murals is a RECLAMATION of Indigenous Science in acrylic paint. Indigenous Science and the discoveries we use every day, but which are thought of as \"Western Scientific Ingenuity”. The chemical structures and formulas in the background are pre-contact scientific knowledge commonly used by the many indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere, the people of the Condor and the Eagle. One of the three murals I have at the Bickford Center is a female empowering mural about the Three Sisters companion planting practice of the Haudenosaunee. Three beautiful strong sisters who support, protect and nurture each other for the benefit of the Haudenosaunee people.\n   I have taken on the duty to represent our indigenous culture in a contemporary context. My artistic styles will create a mural that is very much a part of present-day life, imbued with indigenous knowledge of environmental responsibility, holistic wellness, a place of community and family with a shared future for all.",

        "artist_bio": "Early on, I perceived that my ambition was the act of painting itself, finding that the process coincided with the workings of my conscious and unconscious mind.Throughout my career I have also been fascinated by realism, specifically trompe l’oeil and it’s ability to affect the viewer. I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

When steam locomotive first appeared, it was commonly referred to as 'The Iron Horse'. Just as horses were replaced by trains, the rail bridge is no longer used for its original intent. The silhouetted horses and the bridge, an artifact from our industrial heritage, are surrounded by more modern forms of transportation with Yonge St below and the subway to the west. Originally installed in 1994, the new sculpture is made of 90% recycled fibreglass materials. A solar-powered LED lighting system will soon illuminate the horses and the pedestrian pathway and make the silhouettes more visible at night.  Photos by Tyler Radell.",

I look for themes or visuals alive in the neighbourhood and try to continue the conversation. Finally, I explore opportunities to inject illusion or magic. The result is a backdrop that honours the beauty of urban life.\n\nThis summer I will complete Muralroutes' Mural Art Career Development programme. I'm eager to paint more murals and further incorporate painting into my practice. I gravitate particularly towards public work for its accessibility and power to interact directly with its environment. Coming from a commercial background, I also appreciate the possibilities to intersect both cultural and commercial spaces.\n\nI'm excited to work with StART on projects that bring our city to life.\n\nBIO\nNuff has a hard time colouring inside the lines. He makes apps, brand identities and installations. His independent practice spans commerce and culture, across client, self-driven and public projects. He is a member of Ryerson University's Design Fabrication Zone and the 2018-19 Akin Studio Program at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Toronto.",

I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

I feel the more mediums , styles and tools create more infinite forms and and ever lasting growing process.\n\nThrough these practices, he has established a signature style of his own called, 'Ancient Graffuturism'.\nIn this he combines elements of abstract art,Manga,international Architecture, Calligraphy, Graffiti & Ancient Filipino Design Inspired Images & Symbols.\nBeing a Diaspora, Rowell likes to blend his asian heritage into his work to feel more connected with himself.\n\n\nI want to work with StART because I Share a common Thread with the organization which is to create and protect communities and businesses. I do this for a living so If I can join forces with the organization we could become more of a powerful positive force and spread love through mural art. I would like to learn from StART anything that comes with mural making, Mural planning, community engagement, outreach. I know a little bit about each element but there will always be more to learn. I am good at working with people. I have colloborated many times in the city and internationally on Murals. I am open to learning and working with new people in StART . I feel there is so much that Artists, StART's Organization have to offer and looking forward to seeing what stART has in store.",

        "artist_bio": "Amir Akbari is a Greater Toronto Area (GTA) based Visual Artist, Educator, Community Advocate and Entrepreneur.   In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

Her ongoing work with StARToronto dates back to 2015. Her murals, like the most recent 500 ft. mural titled \"Our Medicines\"  located at the underpass at Dupont and Shaw, or \"The Ancestral Tree Spirits\" located at the Nordheimer Ravine's TTC station exit, depict a colourful  First Nations cosmovision in relation to the Original lands of Ontario, working closely with Anishnawbe  mentors, Elders and Knowledge Keepers. Gonzalez-Ossa is currently  the Indigenous Education Officer at the AGO’s Weston Learning Centre, as part of the Public Programming and Learning Department, and the Visual Arts instructor and mentoring artist at Na Me Res Sagatay Native Men's Residence. She brings 19 years experience as a  Community Youth Worker with youth at risk in Toronto's West.Some of her previous public works include: a 120 foot mural honoring First Nations from North and South America,  which was the recipient of  the 2014 Ward 27 City Builder’s Award, formerly at Allan Gardens. Other locations sport a ribbon-style mural at Women’s Residence, a women’s shelter at Dundas and Bathurst, in collaborations with an all women crew (2015), and a 4 wall rendition of the Medicine Wheel, inside of Na Me Res Sagatay’s courtyard (2016).  In sharp contrast she produced an indoor mural with 22 students from grades 6-8 at refugee host school Beverley Heights Middle School (2017).She recently served in the capacity of Resident Artist at the Power Plant gallery, developing mural arts programs at two satellite locations with youth from priority neighbouroods in Toronto’s West.(2017-2018). In 2018-2019 she worked closely with the 7Th Generation Image Makers at the Native Youth Resource Centre to mentor, facilitate and produce a mural with an all Indigenous women’s team, located  at the South facing wall at Christie Pits Park’s Alex Duff Memorial Pool. Her two most recent productions  funded by StART’s Partnership Grant in 2019,located at the front façade of Sagatay Naïve Men’s Residence, and the adjacent alley,  depict  “Medicines and Guardians”, as well as “The Wolves Running South”.Last but not least, Gonzalez-Ossa is one of the featured artists at the “You’ve Changed “ exhibit by STARToronto , at St Lawrence Market’s  “Market Gallery”. At the exhibit, the video display shows us her latest short documentary produced  for SART, about the basic protocols entailed when developing images in partnership with Indigenous Nations here in Canada.Gonzalez-Ossa  has been  voted Best Graffiti Artist for the City of Toronto by Now Magazine’s Reader’s Poll in 1997, in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

        "artist_bio": "I want to work with StART because the projects I have completed with Street Art Toronto's help have been not only the most enjoyable projects I have worked on in my career, but also the most lucrative for me, in terms of both payment and scale of exposure. I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

        "artist_bio": "Peru is an internationally recognized muralist and graphic artist whose practice is informed by digital and traditional art forms and his 20+ years of painting graffiti. Peru’s professional career started when he moved from Lima to Ottawa at 16; he won every Visual Arts Award in his high school, a Canadian Heritage grant to paint a mural in Vancouver for the International Earth Festival, and a 2 mural commission for the National Capital Commission. At age 20 he moved to Montreal where he continued winning prizes and awards from design contests at his local skateshop to the Millennium Excellence Scholarship.\n\nHis passion for art lead him to rise to the top of the local art scene working for brands and companies such as Bell, Cirque du Soleil and he painted a series of murals with the collective En Masse at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. With En Masse, Peru was part of dozens of collaborative murals throughout Canada, US, Mexico and China, and participated in mentorship programs with the Quebec English School Boards Association. He was also a central muralist for MU since its inception in 2007 and continues to work with them, most recently in 2020 where he will be painting the exterior of a high school.\n\nWhen Peru moved to Toronto a decade later he worked for Urban Outfitters for 5 years as a Lead Display Artist. In this role he built and installed window and store displays participating in store openings across North America including the company’s largest store opening at Herald Square in New York City. Peru used these experiences to expand his skill set and work on art installations at the Osheaga Music Festival as well for American Express for their Live Life Experience Installations around the world; All the while establishing himself as a muralist by assisting, collaborating, and consulting for nearly every arts organization in Toronto, and mentoring individuals, peers and on several occasions’ at-risk youth from the Oasis Skateboard Factory. Peru’s corporate and big brand murals allowed him to balance his work with grass-roots organizations, non-for-profits and BIA’s which make up most of his portfolio. Some of Peru’s corporate clients include Facebook, Nike, Adidas, Corus, Maple Leaf Sports, and Marriott Hotels., Working with StArt and seeing the positive impact it has on neighbourhoods, people and the development of artists is inspiring and makes me proud to be a part of.\n\nCanadian graffiti artist Alexander Bacon began painting in the 90’s as a teenager.  He is best known for his colourful works lining the alleys and streets of Toronto and achieved international recognition.  Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto.",

I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences from which to draw inspiration; a love of creativity in all its forms; a love of culture and the similarities/differences between us all, which makes this world so beautiful.I am inspired by pen & ink fairy tale illustrations, the female form & nature motifs of art nouveau and art deco, the connection of spirit between us and nature of indigenous art, the images/icons/emblems of indigenous culture, and depicting my emotions relating to family/history/current affairs. My favourite medium is dipped pen and ink, especially blue ink: blue like at twilight a time of transition, blue like the water which is women's privilege to cherish and protect.\n    I am known for my blue dipped pen & ink drawings which incorporate science, history, current affairs, empathy and\ngracefulness with beautiful female figures in my unique style I call N8V (native) Nouveau. In the past couple of years, I have painted 7 murals ranging in size from 5' x 8' up to 19' x 50'. One of these murals is a RECLAMATION of Indigenous Science in acrylic paint. Indigenous Science and the discoveries we use every day, but which are thought of as \"Western Scientific Ingenuity”. The chemical structures and formulas in the background are pre-contact scientific knowledge commonly used by the many indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere, the people of the Condor and the Eagle. One of the three murals I have at the Bickford Center is a female empowering mural about the Three Sisters companion planting practice of the Haudenosaunee. Three beautiful strong sisters who support, protect and nurture each other for the benefit of the Haudenosaunee people.\n   I have taken on the duty to represent our indigenous culture in a contemporary context. My artistic styles will create a mural that is very much a part of present-day life, imbued with indigenous knowledge of environmental responsibility, holistic wellness, a place of community and family with a shared future for all.",

        "artist_bio": "Sean Martindale is an internationally recognized, award winning interdisciplinary artist and designer based in Toronto, Canada. His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTA’s largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of Toronto’s Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBC’s Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront Centre’s inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\n•\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate people’s attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

Although I did not study art in college or university, I have been drawing and painting since I was 4. Without computers, I paint unique mixed media backgrounds with realistic paintings/drawings of insects and animals, which stir the viscera in observers and spark a desire in them to learn more about the insects and why we need them. Creating visual art is a Spiritual experience for me as I am presently reclaiming my family’s lost Indigenous genealogy from the East coast of Turtle Island. Painting animals is connecting me to ancestors I didn't know about until two years ago. I live in Toronto with my son.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit Blanche’s exhibition in Scarborough Town Centre’s subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ­An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. Blake’s work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. Blake’s past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ‘one of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in Canada’ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",

        "artist_bio": "I was born after the revolution in Iran. The idea of freedom greatly influenced my whole life not only as an artist but as a human being. I began painting at an art university. My style draws upon elements of traditional Persian painting (Persian Miniatures), the “flatness” and unique composition of which are surprisingly contemporary.\nAfter getting my BFA, I studied Graphic Design at TM university in Tehran. Meanwhile, I started working as a freelance illustrator. Over the past 10 years I have illustrated more than 30 children’s books in Turkey and Iran and all the time I was trying to tell my story with my special language, picture language.\nMy works have been shown in exhibitions and book fairs in Iran, The Emirates, and South Korea but I got inspired by this idea a few years ago which is that the art that we should be doing today in the 21st century should not be just for the museum, it’s art for the street and for people in their daily lives. Also thinking about freedom and social justice in my country lead me to express what I’m feeling through my artworks on street walls so after I answered a call for submissions from Tehran City Hall I started to learn about and experience mural painting.\nSince then, I’ve opened my mind and eyes to observe other mural artists' experiences. After coming to Toronto I’ve found a great number of mural artists and I’ve seen their artworks in the city. Having this great chance to learn from one of them , one of the greatest ones, Nick Sweetman as mentor through a mentorship program by Toronto Ar Council, since then I did some mural projects, trying to improve my skills and techniques an learn more and more. makes me feel so excited and enthusiastic. My style has changed from Miniature to Mural but, like my work as an illustrator, I try to use this medium's potential for telling stories.",

        "artist_bio": "My name is Jeff Blackburn and I am a visual artist based in Toronto. With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that they’ve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

Every time I make work for the public I learn something new; whether that’s a new painting technique or speaking to someone in the community and how the artwork affects them. Working with StART would allow me these special opportunities.\n\nBio\nJenn Kitagawa is an award-winning multidisciplinary illustrator and artist who grew up in the prairies and cities of Alberta, Canada. She is of Japanese descent and is 4th generation, or Yonsei. She graduated from the MacEwan University and the Alberta College of Art & Design, studying both graphic design and illustration. Shortly after receiving her Bachelors of Design, Jenn moved to New York where she interned for illustrator and artist Mike Perry and for the fashion magazine Nylon.\n\nJenn’s body of work- illustration, gifs, painted murals and installations, engages in a dialogue of openness and curiosity. Her creative explorations are unbounded by medium specificity- they are instead inspired by playfulness, colour, and positivity. She pushes the boundaries between art and design, blurs the lines between tangible and intangible goods and inspires wonder.\n\nJenn has created work for clients ranging from Facebook to Arts & Crafts Records, and had the honour of creating the album artwork for Gord Downie’s record Introduce Yerself. She has previously assisted muralist Kirsten McCrea on a community engaged mural for Telus in Scarborough, painted for the city of Toronto with the StART Project, and last year for Bell Box Mural Projects. She has also painting for the arts market Market Collective in Calgary, leading a community based paint-by-number mural and in May 2019 she painted a large interactive mural.",

Generally, my work is influenced by how colours and how they shape a subject can express universal stories or emotions especially applying them on portraits to elaborate on the subject's nuanced story/mood. Since my work is essentially influenced by formless colours and emotions, my process basically involves trying to form or incorporate these colours/shapes into the subject I'm reinterpreting into my style. My overall goal for getting involved with StART is to essentially learn and challenge myself in new ways to express that colourful vision.",

I have been involved in various community-led projects, private and commercial mural commissions. The most impactful projects that I've been apart of, have led me to mentor youth artists and that has been the most rewarding part of those projects. An extension of youth mentorship, I'm also the Artist-in-Residence at Waterfront Neighbourhood Centre. I instruct Room 13, an international Studio that guides a growing network of student-run arts studios in schools and community settings globally. In the past few years, I have been apart of numerous Bell Box Murals Project throughout the city as well as START Outside the Box in 2018.",

        "artist_bio": "I was born after the revolution in Iran. The idea of freedom greatly influenced my whole life not only as an artist but as a human being. I began painting at an art university. My style draws upon elements of traditional Persian painting (Persian Miniatures), the “flatness” and unique composition of which are surprisingly contemporary.\nAfter getting my BFA, I studied Graphic Design at TM university in Tehran. Meanwhile, I started working as a freelance illustrator. Over the past 10 years I have illustrated more than 30 children’s books in Turkey and Iran and all the time I was trying to tell my story with my special language, picture language.\nMy works have been shown in exhibitions and book fairs in Iran, The Emirates, and South Korea but I got inspired by this idea a few years ago which is that the art that we should be doing today in the 21st century should not be just for the museum, it’s art for the street and for people in their daily lives. Also thinking about freedom and social justice in my country lead me to express what I’m feeling through my artworks on street walls so after I answered a call for submissions from Tehran City Hall I started to learn about and experience mural painting.\nSince then, I’ve opened my mind and eyes to observe other mural artists' experiences. After coming to Toronto I’ve found a great number of mural artists and I’ve seen their artworks in the city. Having this great chance to learn from one of them , one of the greatest ones, Nick Sweetman as mentor through a mentorship program by Toronto Ar Council, since then I did some mural projects, trying to improve my skills and techniques an learn more and more. makes me feel so excited and enthusiastic. My style has changed from Miniature to Mural but, like my work as an illustrator, I try to use this medium's potential for telling stories.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

I have a particular interest in supporting the art experience of families and children, and I carry my creativity and desire to connect through to my teaching practice. I have experience managing, curating, and instructing Art and Art History lessons at various schools and art studios in the GTA. I have taught art curriculums for school aged children, as well as individual workshops for all ages and groups, and I teach English as a foreign language.\n\nMy projects vary, but I am always thrilled by new possibilities, forever thinking of ways to apply myself. My illustrations are often concerned with the quality of a moment - perhaps the mystery of an unknown figure or the delight of a nostalgic object. Use of soft colours, gentle line art, and figurative subject matter has often been a characteristic of my work. The projects and materials I engage with may vary greatly, as I am always open to new inspirations and chances to grow.\n\nI hope to always be conscious of the potential my work has to inspire, represent, and encourage — particularly with young viewers. Art has a profound impact on our every days lives — it builds character, opens minds, and forges relationships. My ardent desire to contribute to the street art scene is rooted in my conviction that art is for everyone. I am profoundly grateful to those artists who transform the city (and my experience of it) with their work. As a creator, I feel I must remain aware of how I can make artwork more accessible, in part by bringing my illustrations to the streets.\n\nPrograms like StART create a vital link between artists and communities. While I am motivated to make my artwork more accessible to the public, StART makes my goals as an artist more viable when too often I am inhibited by the financial barriers of creating and distributing art independently. I am deeply appreciative of this program and I am invigorated as an artist by the opportunities StART offers each year to learn and to share.",

Born and raised in Tehran/Iran, Yasaman’s love of art began as a child and further Shaped by her studies at Brock University in Visual Arts, and Visual Communication and Graphic Design from Iran. Her unique art works are mainly influenced by nature.\nStriving to create work that is distinctive, engaging and above all, memorable, she conveys a story or invokes a certain emotion in each of her works. She believes art is one of the purest forms of communication. In addition to painting and design she contributes to public and street art as well. Her goal is to be more engaged in beautifying city and involving in the community.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nI’m passionate about creativity. When I start to create a piece of art, my mind and body become united and empowered in the process of making! Nature is my inspiration. Usually I spend some time in nature , taking some photos ( I do professional photography as well) and I try to incorporate what I see in my paintings but not in a realistic way. I get inspired by forms, colours or even sounds. I transfer my feeling and emotion into the painting surface; It’s my way of story telling.\n\nI would like to be involved with StART because with my background in creativity and art, I see myself growing in public art and I want to put any effort to be engage in communities. I love to do art for people and see them enjoy their environments. In my opinion, Art is communication; it allows people from different cultures and different times to communicate with each other via images, sounds and stories. My responsibility as an artist is to be engage in my society and help people to get more connected with each other and their environment.\nI want to do bigger projects and experience different platforms. I’m interested in both individual projects and team projects.",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

As a Canadian-Colombian artist is empowering for me to paint around the themes of culture, nature, and identity enriching Canadian multiculturalism. Most of my murals are found in Canada and Colombia, my wish is to continue painting across Canada and the world.",

And by night, (and on weekends) I transform into a Hand Letterer, Muralist, and most recently a Calligrapher. Born, raised, and living in Toronto, I have always been passionate about visual arts. With a Bachelor of Design from OCAD University, I graduated in 2013 and entered into the design world with the majority of my work being digital. Due to a strong desire to create with my hands again in the last few years, I have returned to the traditional art of drawing and painting. Bringing this handmade feel and human touch back into my work makes it that much more memorable and unique.\n\nOutdoor painting was a curiosity I first explored a few years ago when I decided to paint a vibrant mural on my porch as an end-of-summer activity and homage to my favourite artists and art movements. The larger canvas was something different and exciting for me to force me out of my comfort zone and challenge me to paint on an imperfect surface. Bringing colour and life to my neighbourhood was also something I thoroughly enjoyed, along with the unexpected interactions with people passing by for a smile, a chat or even a compliment. Engaging with a community through the creation of an art piece was such a magical experience for me that has me hooked on murals ever since! In the past year, I have created a few indoor murals for offices, whether it was painted or created digitally as a vinyl sticker to create a statement wall.\n\nI have been following StART for about a year, admiring all the amazing projects in our city and would love to be a part of it. I am super excited to say that my first project with StART will be next week when I paint my first utility box! I would love to learn more about the Toronto mural world and how to get involved in more projects, learning from experienced artists and helping them out. Participating in StART initiatives and being part of a larger community of artists and art lovers that are making our city a better place to live, one street art piece at a time, would be a dream! At the end of the day, I just want to create art that engages and resonates with people and what better way to do this than to contribute to this organization. Since discovering StART, I have been so motivated by the beautiful mural art, it has encouraged me to reach out to artists, explore new neighbourhoods hunting for murals, and collaborate with like-minded artists. I believe that having a community of artists support each other and create together is so important and truly inspiring. I would love to give back to my home city of Toronto and create some magic with the help of StART.",

Since then, I have worked in Russia, in the United Arab Emirates for over ten years, and for four years in North York, Toronto, where I now live.  As a figurative oil painter, I work with landscapes, portraits, still lifes, etc.  My art is influenced by older European classical tradition of my training, but also by impressionist technique and by the more playful colours and modern, expressive styles of painters like Marc Chagall, Franz Marc, Paul Gaugin, and others.  This openness and flexibility has been very important in my prolific second career as a children’s book illustrator in the very large Arab language publishing market and now in Canada where I continue to illustrate.",

As an immigrant artist she often explores the concept of “home”, and the sense of wistful longing and nostalgia that it brings out in her work.\nHer childhood experience became a strong incentive for her to make illustrations that depict women as beautiful, empowered, and strong. As a result, her current work is devoted to the investigation of whimsical shapes of feminism in today’s world.\n\nI would like to work with StART as I have had wonderful experiences working with you in the past, and I would like to keep this collaboration growing.

After studying business at Western Ontario in London, ON, and working in the accounting field for a number of years he reconnected with his true passion for Art. During his year long leave from Toronto, he travelled back to his home-town Wei Fang, China and a number of other countries such as Vietnam, Japan and Spain. On that journey he discovered amazing murals around the world. Inspired by all that he saw, Victor began leaving murals of his own at each city he travelled to. They told stories that relate to the history of the community. Some were simply figures filled with colour based on the folk tales he grew up with.",

        "artist_bio": "I am a Toronto-based illustrator, muralist and comics artist working out of a studio space on Dupont that I share with other 3 artists. While a lot of my illustration work is done for editorial or corporate clients, I’ve also had the opportunity to work on some community-based and public artwork projects over the past 2 years that I’ve been especially excited about. Through involvement with StART, I would love to find out about more opportunities to create public mural art that lives in and complements the community it is a part of. I think art in the public realm is so interesting to me because of how impactful it can be on mundane life – a visual break in the expected city patterns of shopfront, garage door, lamppost, parking meter. Even an escape. Themes of the idiosyncratic in the ordinary, the dichotomy between real and imagined, are things that my own work is interested in exploring, along with a sense of whimsy and play.\n\nDuring the past few summers, I’ve been able to work on the Outside the Box traffic signal mural project, Womxn Paint in Toronto and in Rexdale, and the Lightup Laneway project. The outdoor murals I’ve completed have used a combination of exterior latex paint and spray paint, and in the future I’d like to explore more of how these mediums can work together, as well as improve on my ability to use spray paint which I was introduced to through Womxn Paint. Through public hoarding projects with PATCH (Mississauga and Region of Peel Watermain hoarding near Celebration Square; Bay Adelaide hoarding) I also have experience producing digital images for large-scale digital printing.\n\nThis upcoming year, I hope to have more opportunities to learn about making public artwork that supports the community it is a part of. I also want to challenge myself to work on larger, more varied projects that offer the opportunity for diversity in imagery and representation. I want to try new painting techniques with elements such as gradients and textures, and involve spray painting more in my mural work. I’m also interested in obtaining heights certification so that I’m able to work on larger walls should the opportunity arise. And I’d like to think about how – in mural making as in other life practises – I can do so with greater attention to sustainable practises and to the impact of what I’m doing. In general, I’d love increased opportunities to help make the site I’m painting in both reflective of and interesting to the imaginations of those who live here.",

Bacon describes the art form as being passed down from one generation to the next.\nHis work has evolved to deconstructing traditional graffiti spray paint techniques to create an abstract graffiti style while maintaining letter form.  His use of a mature colour pallet and mixing of realism with the stylized graffiti fonts gives his work a unique look with smooth transitions and texture.\nMost recently Bacon has been doing large scale murals and Canvas work while maintaining the disciplines of graffiti.  His work can be seen all over Toronto.",

StART’s vision to create beautiful and safer public spaces with a mandate to act inclusively, celebrate our strengths in diversity, to acknowledge and respect the cultures and lands of Indigenous persons, and mentor emerging talents, all reflect my own values in my professional and personal life.\n\nI’ve been an artist for 20 years in the public realm, having exhibited in public art galleries, artist-run centres, art festivals, and having worked with public/private planning teams to create permanent public art with budgets up to $56,000.00 (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital). I work in several disciplines including sculpture (polyurethane resins, concrete, casting techniques), installation art (interactive works that light up, make noise, or move - typically destined for art festivals/events such as Nuit Blanche, Animating Our Waterfront, Hamilton Supercrawl), and painting murals.\n\nMy passion for community arts participation cemented over 15 years ago when I sat on the board of Carfac Ontario as Vice Chair, with Merlin Homer as Chair, a Mohawk Elder whom I consider as a mentor. We had an exceptional team of strong arts leaders and my experience at Carfac helped mould my understanding of fair remuneration, cultural/ethnic/language/gender challenges that artists’ face, and the importance of advocating for one another’s communities.  Profoundly affected by this experience, I’ve continued to work with communities and have co-founded three successful art collectives, Open Field Collective, KJ Bit, and Creativo Collective, whose mandates are to create artwork and murals in public spaces while being inclusive of surrounding communities. In 2017, the Open Field Collective was awarded the national ArtBridges award for “Innovation” in recognition of our dedication to community engagement and our “Street Projects” where we invented miniature art galleries to create and display artwork in public spaces such as residential front yards, King Street (Public Realm), and Guelph. We’ve partnered with Scouts Canada, Neilson Creative Centre (Etobicoke), King Edward PS, been sponsored by Waterfront Toronto, and supported by Neighbourhood Associations and private and corporate donors.\n\nLast year, I was lead coordinator for one of StreetARToronto’s laneway mural/graffiti projects. It was a wonderful opportunity to mentor my KJ Bit collaborator, June Kim, as a facilitator in the project. This summer, we’ll be coordinating the second phase of this Euclid/Palmerston laneway with a roster of 40 artists and be presenting a WalkShop tour of this laneway for delegates of the National Association of City Transportation Officials. This September, we’ll be painting a mural in partnership with StreetARToronto and TTC at Finch Station. My goal is to continue painting more murals, participating in more laneway jams and creating new, innovative street art events. I’d love to continue working with StreetARToronto because I believe we have mutual respect for the experience and expertise that both sides bring to the table. Above all, I love learning new things, and StreetARToronto has given me a great opportunity to grow as an artist and a facilitator.",

I create images that exist on paper, walls, objects, spaces, and stages. I am interested in using imagery as an opportunity to explore the world, the environment and social issues. I want the public art that I make to be bright and colourful, something that might attract someone's attention as they walk by. I like to create dense images where flat colourful shapes fill the entire wall/object, which can deter graffiti but also can allow for the viewer to notice something new after repeated viewings. In recent projects “Night on the town” or “Canoe with wildlife” (attached below), I tried to connect the imagery to something interesting about the area: the former is a reference to jazz clubs that used to exist in the east side of toronto, and the latter is a tribute the canoe butterfly gardens that can be found in parks throughout the city. I draw people with a looseness in their form, joyously moving and interacting. I would love to be involved with START and create more community engaged art and collaborate with other artists. I am interested in creating images for different spaces and it is a goal of mine to create work in different cities in Canada and internationally.",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

        "artist_bio": "Roshni Wijayasinha is a Toronto based visual artist who specializes in large abstract expressionist paintings that are inspired by nature and its energy. Using acrylic and mixed media, these paintings experiment with light, colours, textures and finishes, and many of her pieces can be transformed under a black light, or glow in the dark. Her work has been featured at several juried exhibits and galleries across North America, in product launches, at a food festival, in a permanent collection at a Hilton Hotel in Toronto, in publications, and can be found on the streets of Toronto on 6 traffic boxes.\n\nMy experience painting the START traffic box at Front & John Street was a wonderful collaboration with the public, inviting people of all ages and different nationalities (high tourist traffic) make a small mark on this piece. I'm interested in participating in more street art around Toronto, to help liven our streets, bring energy and positivity to our neighbourhoods and people. Engaging our community in the process, I would love the opportunity to be able to deliver happiness and surprise and delight passers by as I do with my vivid glow in the dark paintings. I welcome the opportunity to work with other more established street artists, to learn more about outdoor art and public engagement, share our skills and techniques and grow together. I would also love to share my love of colour and light with other emerging artists, teaching them about how different materials can be used to create different lighting effects.",

        "artist_bio": "Christina Mazzulla is a Toronto based multi-disciplinary artist who specializes in spray paint and mixed-media work. She is well known for her mural contributions throughout the city and paintings comprised of intricate cutouts and exploration of combined media. Her artwork is heavily informed by psychedelic imagery, incorporating wildlife, fantasy, landscapes, and electric colour gradients. Christina has been working as a professional artist and showcasing work having graduated from OCADU in 2012, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Her passion for street art combined with traditional fine art training has helped her form a unique style, and gain a large following throughout North America. Christina continues her creative pursuits within the gallery scene, while also remaining one of the few active female graffiti artists within Toronto. She has provided many commissioned murals for large businesses and non-profit organizations including American Express, Universal Music, Chevrolet Canada, PangeaSeed Foundation, and The David Suzuki Foundation. She has worked with City of Toronto BIA's and StArt Toronto, along with many privately funded mural projects, with hopes to continue working with other street art initiatives., I want to work with StART because the projects I have completed with Street Art Toronto's help have been not only the most enjoyable projects I have worked on in my career, but also the most lucrative for me, in terms of both payment and scale of exposure. I learn something new on every project we do together and working with StART staff has taught me virtually everything I know about what goes into publicly-funded street art projects, all the moving parts that need to be accounted for, communicating with the public, coordinating materials and other artists, publicity, etc. I want to keep building on this knowledge and skill set as we continue to spread colourful mural projects into new parts of the city/GTA.\n\nBio:\nNick Sweetman is a multidisciplinary artist from Toronto whose practice has explored painting and its intersection with photography, video, installation, mixed media, and urban intervention. He has exhibited in galleries around Toronto since 2011, completing his MFA in 2014 from OCAD University in the Interdisciplinary Art, Media & Design program. He received a certificate from the Mural Routes Leadership Training in Mural-Making program the same year and since then has been working in public space on mural projects, often in collaboration with other artists, and in partnership with various non-profit organizations (David Suzuki Foundation, The STEPS Initiative) as well as Street Art Toronto. He has successfully managed many large-scale projects both independently and as lead artist over a team of volunteers, from children up to adults. He has dedicated many projects to raising awareness about the importance of pollinators, bees and butterflies in particular, from painting giant bees towering over busy city streets to coordinating 30 or more artists to paint butterflies on garages in Toronto's laneways. Most recently, Nick has been working abroad, participating in the Eureka Street Art Festival in Humboldt County, California as well as contributing a mural to the Bondi Beach Sea Wall in Sydney, Australia.",

At 22 the desire to learn and evolve my skill set into a business has greatly expanded, motivating me to work with programs such as START. I have a great love for letters and graffiti, as well as a background in fine arts. I studied illustration for a few years at Sheridan college, during which my interest in realism grew. I hope as a young artist that collaborating with others will help me solidify my own \"style\", and sense of confidence. My goal would be to work on/ create pieces which allow me to expand upon graffiti and realism,and potentially combine the two.\n(I move to the city in May and drive if location is an issue).",

After living in Singapore for the last two years,  he has returned to Toronto to continue freelancing as a Mural / Graffiti Artist, Illustrator and Graphic Designer. In his early beginnings, his interest in visual communication was sparked by graffiti and street art. These forms influenced him heavily, his style reflecting the vibrant and often bold nature of urban art. This also encouraged the development of letters, calligraphy & characters which are a large part of his work.\n\nBlaze takes inspiration from all facets of his own life experiences, and strives to create imagery which reflects lessons that he has learned along with social commentary. He believes that large mural artwork in the public sphere has a responsibility to create questions in the viewers mind and encourage critical thinking. Blaze utilises spray paint and exterior latex to create his exterior and interior work. He strives to work with StART's amazing team to further develop his mural work, add to the already impressive visual landscape of Toronto, and also creating opportunities for emerging artists to grow and develop along side him.",

Art continues to form an inner dialogue between viewer and content. The unconscious movement through painting produces a learning experience for audience and artist. Visual elements and aesthetics within one’s control, judged and defined. Allow oneself to interact with the uncontrollable, to embrace the sense of boundless energy.\n\nI would love to share moments and experiences with a community audience to help influence creative growth and community connections using visual art.",

With StART’s support I want to be mentored in my mural career with any opportunities to connect with seasoned mural/street artists and get on a swing-stage, aerial lift, use a spray gun, while learning to comprehend XL large walls and huge quantities of paint among advanced techniques of execution and project production. I’ve currently reached the stage of painting garages in Toronto and am interested and ready to go larger.\n\nBio & Artist Statement\nAnya Mielniczek is a Toronto based multidisciplinary artist who combines her fine art background with raw material grit in both private and public sectors creating mixed-media installations, mural work and facilitating community art activations.\nThe artists approach to mediums includes latex, aerosol and up-cycled waste, working with the mechanical application of spray and the energy of hand brushed strokes (infused with powerful female portraits and garbage bits if possible).\nA Queen’s University graduate, Anya’s worked with various organizations, municipalities and businesses creating public art within communities around Toronto and internationally.

I hold a Bachelor of Design from OCAD U, a postgraduate in Typography and a Master in Art from Penninghen (Paris). In regards to my experience as a muralist, I have painted on various surfaces and I count on getting my Working at Heights certificate this summer. I aim to make Toronto a better place for everyone.\n\nArtist Statement: My work originates from a mixture of Colombia and Canada. Loud and bold colours have been my signature for many years. My pieces call upon nature, reminiscent of my childhood years,  incorporating them in my life as a Canadian. Inspired by my years in France, I incorporate many techniques.\n\nEvery day, our city is being loaded with more concrete and I am actively trying to bring some colour into it. I illustrate plants and flowers because they bring happiness. Colour makes you forget about the imperfections of life, so I try to aim for colourful pieces.\n\nWhen I started my master's degree, I was optimistic about the prospects of being an art director. However, the more classes advanced, the more I realized I was not meant to take on that role. My process to develop this style started in my first year of my master, when I was asked to re-imagined Boschs' Garden of Earthly Delights.  I started drawing plants and flowers from my native Colombia and mixing them with my Canadianness. The result had an interesting narrative, somewhat descriptive of my duality.\n\nNow back in Canada, I have taken the time to draw from real plants. I go around to gardens and conservatories in Toronto, grabbing inspiration everywhere I visit.  I have produced a series of nature drawings, that symbolize my love for this city.  My approach is not looking only at the form of the plants, but transforming them into a  visual language.  In the end, I aim to bring colour, plants and happiness to wherever my art goes.",

These projects have become meaningful and rewarding experiences for me as I got a chance to share my narrative with my community, alter spaces and engage public. I’ve participated in collaborative murals with Mural Routes and Artbarn School. I have also completed my own projects as a lead artist in a cafe, Art Fair and Public School.

Born and raised in Tehran/Iran, Yasaman’s love of art began as a child and further Shaped by her studies at Brock University in Visual Arts, and Visual Communication and Graphic Design from Iran. Her unique art works are mainly influenced by nature.\nStriving to create work that is distinctive, engaging and above all, memorable, she conveys a story or invokes a certain emotion in each of her works. She believes art is one of the purest forms of communication. In addition to painting and design she contributes to public and street art as well. Her goal is to be more engaged in beautifying city and involving in the community.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nI’m passionate about creativity. When I start to create a piece of art, my mind and body become united and empowered in the process of making! Nature is my inspiration. Usually I spend some time in nature , taking some photos ( I do professional photography as well) and I try to incorporate what I see in my paintings but not in a realistic way. I get inspired by forms, colours or even sounds. I transfer my feeling and emotion into the painting surface; It’s my way of story telling.\n\nI would like to be involved with StART because with my background in creativity and art, I see myself growing in public art and I want to put any effort to be engage in communities. I love to do art for people and see them enjoy their environments. In my opinion, Art is communication; it allows people from different cultures and different times to communicate with each other via images, sounds and stories. My responsibility as an artist is to be engage in my society and help people to get more connected with each other and their environment.\nI want to do bigger projects and experience different platforms. I’m interested in both individual projects and team projects.",

Frannie enjoys using bright colours and juxtaposing images as a tool to captivate the viewer in a thought-provoking manner; grounding them in the present moment with public art. She uses a variety of mediums throughout her work, such as spray paint, interior/exterior latex, acrylic, ink and digital media. Some of Frannie’s accomplishments include receiving a platinum level certificate in the Mural Art Career Development Course offered by Mural Routes, and completing a three month internship in California with international mural artist John Pugh. These achievements have allowed her to gain contacts in the industry and confidence as a professional mural artist. Frannie has worked on over 25 indoor and outdoor mural projects to date, which can be viewed throughout the city of Toronto.\n\nFrannie Potts’ first experience working with StART was in partnership with Urban Arts in 2013. Frannie was hired as a youth artist for a mural project painted on MDO boards, which were later installed on a retaining wall by Weston Rd and Rogers Rd. Since then, she’s assisted many large-scale mural projects across the city with lead artists such as Jim Bravo, Emannuel Ciobonnica, Zeesy Powers, Rob Matejka, Ryan Dineen and Sean Martindale. Frannie has had the opportunity to paint independently on garage doors for Toronto’s Laneway Project and participated in painting a mural for Womxn Paint 2019. These experiences allowed her to gain the confidence and skills needed to mentor children and youth as a mural workshop series leader in partnership with VIBE Arts and Access Alliance.\n\nThe time Frannie spent as an assistant artist gave her the privilege to be mentored in a variety of technical, organizational and personable skills. The opportunity to mentor youth was one of Frannie’s favourite parts of assisting murals, and proved to be a rewarding and memorable experience. Each mural project Frannie has had the pleasure of working on in Toronto has given her the opportunity to grow and inspired her to set bigger goals as an artist. Frannie hopes that the next step for her in her artistic career is to lead a large-scale mural project with a team of youth and assistant artists. Frannie feels she has an obligation as an artist to amplify the voices of those in the community she’s working within through the lens of public art.",

I have had the privilege of working on community projects over the past 2 years and the feeling has infected me. I always felt a sense of selfishness working within the confines of my studio and having had the opportunity to contribute my creative passion towards communities and neighbourhoods has motivated me to create in a way I have never felt before.\n\tI work primarily with brushes and house paint and have experience working on a variety of scales, heights and surfaces. I have lead teams of volunteers and also experienced artists. I have worked in artist teams and under the mentorship of an established artist on large scale projects.\n\tI would be honoured to be a part of StART programming and to work on a StART project because I myself align with so many of the goals of the organization. I have created art in and for communities and I have witnessed through how impactful public art is on a neighbourhood and a community. To be connected with a larger organization that has the ability to spread public art across the city of Toronto and bring it to the areas that need it the most would be wonderful as it would allow me the opportunity to further actualize my goals of using my art to create places and spaces that are memorable, safe, accessible and where community members take great pride of ownership.\n\tI have been so lucky as to work alongside Christiano D’Arujo on a StART project on Rogers Rd near Caledonia this past winter, and I got to witness its great impact on the community. It is a personal goal to be involved in more projects like that one and be given the opportunity to learn and grow as an artist from the challenges associated in executing projects of that size.\n\n\tI was working on a mural once and a woman came up to me to tell me how important she thinks public art is. She told me that she had survived an abusive relationship and was in the process of working with the police to convict her abuser. She told me that going to the police station was very difficult and each time she was done she would sit in front of this mural near the place station and look at its beauty and cry tears of joy and gratitude for where she was in her life. I cannot forget this woman or that story because the mural beside the police station is my work and her story is the reason I create work that exists in the world. My work is for people like her in moments like that, when all they need to see is a beautiful reminder of the humanity of all of us and the wonder of the world around us.",

And by night, (and on weekends) I transform into a Hand Letterer, Muralist, and most recently a Calligrapher. Born, raised, and living in Toronto, I have always been passionate about visual arts. With a Bachelor of Design from OCAD University, I graduated in 2013 and entered into the design world with the majority of my work being digital. Due to a strong desire to create with my hands again in the last few years, I have returned to the traditional art of drawing and painting. Bringing this handmade feel and human touch back into my work makes it that much more memorable and unique.\n\nOutdoor painting was a curiosity I first explored a few years ago when I decided to paint a vibrant mural on my porch as an end-of-summer activity and homage to my favourite artists and art movements. The larger canvas was something different and exciting for me to force me out of my comfort zone and challenge me to paint on an imperfect surface. Bringing colour and life to my neighbourhood was also something I thoroughly enjoyed, along with the unexpected interactions with people passing by for a smile, a chat or even a compliment. Engaging with a community through the creation of an art piece was such a magical experience for me that has me hooked on murals ever since! In the past year, I have created a few indoor murals for offices, whether it was painted or created digitally as a vinyl sticker to create a statement wall.\n\nI have been following StART for about a year, admiring all the amazing projects in our city and would love to be a part of it. I am super excited to say that my first project with StART will be next week when I paint my first utility box! I would love to learn more about the Toronto mural world and how to get involved in more projects, learning from experienced artists and helping them out. Participating in StART initiatives and being part of a larger community of artists and art lovers that are making our city a better place to live, one street art piece at a time, would be a dream! At the end of the day, I just want to create art that engages and resonates with people and what better way to do this than to contribute to this organization. Since discovering StART, I have been so motivated by the beautiful mural art, it has encouraged me to reach out to artists, explore new neighbourhoods hunting for murals, and collaborate with like-minded artists. I believe that having a community of artists support each other and create together is so important and truly inspiring. I would love to give back to my home city of Toronto and create some magic with the help of StART.",

While a lot of my illustration work is done for editorial or corporate clients, I’ve also had the opportunity to work on some community-based and public artwork projects over the past 2 years that I’ve been especially excited about. Through involvement with StART, I would love to find out about more opportunities to create public mural art that lives in and complements the community it is a part of. I think art in the public realm is so interesting to me because of how impactful it can be on mundane life – a visual break in the expected city patterns of shopfront, garage door, lamppost, parking meter. Even an escape. Themes of the idiosyncratic in the ordinary, the dichotomy between real and imagined, are things that my own work is interested in exploring, along with a sense of whimsy and play.\n\nDuring the past few summers, I’ve been able to work on the Outside the Box traffic signal mural project, Womxn Paint in Toronto and in Rexdale, and the Lightup Laneway project. The outdoor murals I’ve completed have used a combination of exterior latex paint and spray paint, and in the future I’d like to explore more of how these mediums can work together, as well as improve on my ability to use spray paint which I was introduced to through Womxn Paint. Through public hoarding projects with PATCH (Mississauga and Region of Peel Watermain hoarding near Celebration Square; Bay Adelaide hoarding) I also have experience producing digital images for large-scale digital printing.\n\nThis upcoming year, I hope to have more opportunities to learn about making public artwork that supports the community it is a part of. I also want to challenge myself to work on larger, more varied projects that offer the opportunity for diversity in imagery and representation. I want to try new painting techniques with elements such as gradients and textures, and involve spray painting more in my mural work. I’m also interested in obtaining heights certification so that I’m able to work on larger walls should the opportunity arise. And I’d like to think about how – in mural making as in other life practises – I can do so with greater attention to sustainable practises and to the impact of what I’m doing. In general, I’d love increased opportunities to help make the site I’m painting in both reflective of and interesting to the imaginations of those who live here.",

I hold a Bachelor of Design from OCAD U, a postgraduate in Typography and a Master in Art from Penninghen (Paris). In regards to my experience as a muralist, I have painted on various surfaces and I count on getting my Working at Heights certificate this summer. I aim to make Toronto a better place for everyone.\n\nArtist Statement: My work originates from a mixture of Colombia and Canada. Loud and bold colours have been my signature for many years. My pieces call upon nature, reminiscent of my childhood years,  incorporating them in my life as a Canadian. Inspired by my years in France, I incorporate many techniques.\n\nEvery day, our city is being loaded with more concrete and I am actively trying to bring some colour into it. I illustrate plants and flowers because they bring happiness. Colour makes you forget about the imperfections of life, so I try to aim for colourful pieces.\n\nWhen I started my master's degree, I was optimistic about the prospects of being an art director. However, the more classes advanced, the more I realized I was not meant to take on that role. My process to develop this style started in my first year of my master, when I was asked to re-imagined Boschs' Garden of Earthly Delights.  I started drawing plants and flowers from my native Colombia and mixing them with my Canadianness. The result had an interesting narrative, somewhat descriptive of my duality.\n\nNow back in Canada, I have taken the time to draw from real plants. I go around to gardens and conservatories in Toronto, grabbing inspiration everywhere I visit.  I have produced a series of nature drawings, that symbolize my love for this city.  My approach is not looking only at the form of the plants, but transforming them into a  visual language.  In the end, I aim to bring colour, plants and happiness to wherever my art goes.",

I've been painting as an assistant to Kirsten McCrea (Hello Kirsten) since 2017 and have experienced the affect that street art has on communities firsthand. Painting projects like the underpass at Gerrard and Carlaw introduced me to wonderful people that stopped to thank us for brightening up a space that they encountered every day.  That's why I want to paint murals. That's why I love street art. It transforms the way that people engage with their city. It creates spaces that feel warm and inviting, that foster civic pride, and that make moving through the streets of Toronto more enjoyable.\n\nBeing considered for smaller StART projects would be a wonderful step forward in my career, but 'm also eager to paint with more established street artists as their assistants.  I have my WAH and swing stage certifications, and have assisted Kirsten on projects from start to finish over the past two years. Experiencing how different artists tackle the many challenges that come with each wall would be a huge opportunity.",

I have since been awarded and published a number of times, had a solo exhibition and have created a number of murals around Toronto. I create colourful and whimsical paintings, digital art and GIFs that focus on life as a woman, spirituality and everyday life. I’m a shameless coffee addict and frequent the local cafes. Dancing, yoga and biking are my preferred ways of recharging.\nI started my street art work since 2018 at which point I painted on a utility box for StreetARToronto and since then I have painted multiple small scale murals around Toronto for StreetART, Bell Box Murals including garage doors and concrete walls. I would like to continue expanding my street art practice and beautify the city further.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

        "artist_bio": "I’d love to work with StreetARToronto because I’m inspired by the artistic legacy they are building in the City of Toronto. StART’s vision to create beautiful and safer public spaces with a mandate to act inclusively, celebrate our strengths in diversity, to acknowledge and respect the cultures and lands of Indigenous persons, and mentor emerging talents, all reflect my own values in my professional and personal life.\n\nI’ve been an artist for 20 years in the public realm, having exhibited in public art galleries, artist-run centres, art festivals, and having worked with public/private planning teams to create permanent public art with budgets up to $56,000.00 (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital). I work in several disciplines including sculpture (polyurethane resins, concrete, casting techniques), installation art (interactive works that light up, make noise, or move - typically destined for art festivals/events such as Nuit Blanche, Animating Our Waterfront, Hamilton Supercrawl), and painting murals.\n\nMy passion for community arts participation cemented over 15 years ago when I sat on the board of Carfac Ontario as Vice Chair, with Merlin Homer as Chair, a Mohawk Elder whom I consider as a mentor. We had an exceptional team of strong arts leaders and my experience at Carfac helped mould my understanding of fair remuneration, cultural/ethnic/language/gender challenges that artists’ face, and the importance of advocating for one another’s communities.  Profoundly affected by this experience, I’ve continued to work with communities and have co-founded three successful art collectives, Open Field Collective, KJ Bit, and Creativo Collective, whose mandates are to create artwork and murals in public spaces while being inclusive of surrounding communities. In 2017, the Open Field Collective was awarded the national ArtBridges award for “Innovation” in recognition of our dedication to community engagement and our “Street Projects” where we invented miniature art galleries to create and display artwork in public spaces such as residential front yards, King Street (Public Realm), and Guelph. We’ve partnered with Scouts Canada, Neilson Creative Centre (Etobicoke), King Edward PS, been sponsored by Waterfront Toronto, and supported by Neighbourhood Associations and private and corporate donors.\n\nLast year, I was lead coordinator for one of StreetARToronto’s laneway mural/graffiti projects. It was a wonderful opportunity to mentor my KJ Bit collaborator, June Kim, as a facilitator in the project. This summer, we’ll be coordinating the second phase of this Euclid/Palmerston laneway with a roster of 40 artists and be presenting a WalkShop tour of this laneway for delegates of the National Association of City Transportation Officials. This September, we’ll be painting a mural in partnership with StreetARToronto and TTC at Finch Station. My goal is to continue painting more murals, participating in more laneway jams and creating new, innovative street art events. I’d love to continue working with StreetARToronto because I believe we have mutual respect for the experience and expertise that both sides bring to the table. Above all, I love learning new things, and StreetARToronto has given me a great opportunity to grow as an artist and a facilitator., Jieun June Kim is a Toronto based, Korean born painter and muralist.  She has exhibited her paintings around the world since 2010 at notable galleries and events, exploring the idea of “home” as an immigrant and creating safe space.\nJieun completed the Mural Art Career Development program offered by Mural Routes in 2017 and has since worked with various arts organizations, city of Toronto as well as corporate partners such as Samsung, Up Canada, and Collective Arts Brewery.\n She is the co-founder of KJ Bit Collective who creates murals and street art events, and a member of the Mural Routes advisory committee team. She is also the recipient of the Newcomer and Refugee Artist Mentorship grant from the Toronto Arts Council (2018).",

        "artist_bio": "Enlivened by his interest in spacial structures and interconnectivity, Andre Kan's paintings serve as excitable blueprints for a possible reality. Each work depicts the artists' signature imaginative building blocks that converge and begin to build upon each other and strengthening each other towards an ever transforming space. Kan's structures are substantial and complex but not yet anchored - they float suspended in his psychological space. In this way Kan's buildings remain a playful proposition for the viewer not yet tied to a specific place or function. With his dynamic formations, Kan propels us towards an ever optimistic future where new connections and constructions have yet to materialize.\n\nHis current work investigates the architectural interpretations that respond to our ever advancing society, and suggests what 'possibility' means through self discovery. Examining what mark making and its properties mean, as well as the significance in cause and effect, is important here. Kan's psychological structures depict change and evolution of space, while also questioning the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it.\n\nAndre Kan is a Toronto based painter. Since graduating from the Ontario College of Art & Design University in 2014, he continues his creative pursuits as an Artist, Muralist, Photographer, Curator, Producer, and Musician. His paintings have been showcased throughout Canada with permanent collections in the U.S and China. His murals can also be seen internationally including London, Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.\n\n\n\nEmail: andrekanart@gmail.com\nInstagram: andrekan_\nTwitter: @andrekanart",

As a result, her current work is devoted to the investigation of whimsical shapes of feminism in today’s world.\n\nI would like to work with StART as I have had wonderful experiences working with you in the past, and I would like to keep this collaboration growing.

        "artist_bio": "I want to continue co-collaborating with StART to keep growing as an artist in my skill set, practice and portfolio. With StART’s support I want to be mentored in my mural career with any opportunities to connect with seasoned mural/street artists and get on a swing-stage, aerial lift, use a spray gun, while learning to comprehend XL large walls and huge quantities of paint among advanced techniques of execution and project production. I’ve currently reached the stage of painting garages in Toronto and am interested and ready to go larger.\n\nBio & Artist Statement\nAnya Mielniczek is a Toronto based multidisciplinary artist who combines her fine art background with raw material grit in both private and public sectors creating mixed-media installations, mural work and facilitating community art activations.\nThe artists approach to mediums includes latex, aerosol and up-cycled waste, working with the mechanical application of spray and the energy of hand brushed strokes (infused with powerful female portraits and garbage bits if possible).\nA Queen’s University graduate, Anya’s worked with various organizations, municipalities and businesses creating public art within communities around Toronto and internationally. Recent corporate projects include lead production on HideSeek, a 7000sq foot immersive art experience in Toronto and collaborations with BACARDI, QUO Makeup, Moroccanoil, DELL, RBC, 1800GOTJUNK and Chevrolet. Her commitment to her practice especially when aligned with public spaces is to create with purpose by giving nature a voice while defining a conversation with the viewer that may inspire and bring awareness for sustainable change., Early on, I perceived that my ambition was the act of painting itself, finding that the process coincided with the workings of my conscious and unconscious mind.Throughout my career I have also been fascinated by realism, specifically trompe l’oeil and it’s ability to affect the viewer. I have been creating trompe l’oeil murals in combination with my abstract works for over 20 years now. It has become for me a way to connect with the viewer on several different levels. I have discovered that painting illusions allows me to communicate with a larger audience, as people genuinely delighted when visually tricked. While both painting techniques claim to express reality truthfully, either suggests only a partial or incomplete view of a subject.\nI am also extremely interested in the archival quality of work and how public art is produced, in an ethical and archival way. I have painted murals that are still on display over 20 years later. I feel that viewers of public work have an investment in the upkeep and archival quality of the work. Starting with the proper preparation, the production process should be considered when producing public art. When public art pieces become worn and decay after only a few seasons the public does not see the value in continuing to fund public art. Having worked for several years of trial and error I feel that I could offer proper preparation advice to many of the public art projects.",

        "artist_bio": "Frannie Potts is a Toronto based artist whose vision is to uplift minds, bodies and spirits while providing access to the arts in underserved communities, one mural at a time. Frannie enjoys using bright colours and juxtaposing images as a tool to captivate the viewer in a thought-provoking manner; grounding them in the present moment with public art. She uses a variety of mediums throughout her work, such as spray paint, interior/exterior latex, acrylic, ink and digital media. Some of Frannie’s accomplishments include receiving a platinum level certificate in the Mural Art Career Development Course offered by Mural Routes, and completing a three month internship in California with international mural artist John Pugh. These achievements have allowed her to gain contacts in the industry and confidence as a professional mural artist. Frannie has worked on over 25 indoor and outdoor mural projects to date, which can be viewed throughout the city of Toronto.\n\nFrannie Potts’ first experience working with StART was in partnership with Urban Arts in 2013. Frannie was hired as a youth artist for a mural project painted on MDO boards, which were later installed on a retaining wall by Weston Rd and Rogers Rd. Since then, she’s assisted many large-scale mural projects across the city with lead artists such as Jim Bravo, Emannuel Ciobonnica, Zeesy Powers, Rob Matejka, Ryan Dineen and Sean Martindale. Frannie has had the opportunity to paint independently on garage doors for Toronto’s Laneway Project and participated in painting a mural for Womxn Paint 2019. These experiences allowed her to gain the confidence and skills needed to mentor children and youth as a mural workshop series leader in partnership with VIBE Arts and Access Alliance.\n\nThe time Frannie spent as an assistant artist gave her the privilege to be mentored in a variety of technical, organizational and personable skills. The opportunity to mentor youth was one of Frannie’s favourite parts of assisting murals, and proved to be a rewarding and memorable experience. Each mural project Frannie has had the pleasure of working on in Toronto has given her the opportunity to grow and inspired her to set bigger goals as an artist. Frannie hopes that the next step for her in her artistic career is to lead a large-scale mural project with a team of youth and assistant artists. Frannie feels she has an obligation as an artist to amplify the voices of those in the community she’s working within through the lens of public art.",

The relationships I’ve built, and friends I’ve made as a direct result are invaluable. Moving forward into 2020, I would love to be even more involved, and painting as often as possible.\n\nAs an artist, I’m just looking to evolve with my own craft, always trying something new. Start has certainly provided an enormous amount of room to grow, with a lot of events having overlying themes, pushing me to think outside of the box on many occasions. Typefaces, fonts, and writing continue to be at the fore front of a majority of my work, however I’m also actively working on illustration and furthering techniques for background work as well.\n\nAs a carpenter/GC here in the city I handle so many of the materials going into, and out side of people’s homes. Some of which have wound up being garages in lane way projects! I’ve been drawn to some of these materials to use as elements in new work, recycling old doors and discarded pieces of stone and steel. Finding new forms for them to take at table size, but would ultimately like to scale up to a public installation size. Furniture designing and building has been a big focus in recent years and I believe could integrate so easily into sculpture/street installations.\n\nLast year, with the help of Jodi Callan and the folks at start we received help with getting paint for the vanderhoof skatepark bowl. We have been repainting the bowl for a decade now, every year for a home grown skateboard contest called Hoedown at the Hoof. It was game changing to be able to invite more artists to fill out the entirety of the bowl and have everybody in matching colours. Especially as it was in time to commemorate the raptors win as well. We hope you guys would be happy to work with us again this year!",

His work explores the juxtaposition of nature with human constructs through explorations into challenging humanities anthropocentric views towards ourselves and our environment. He merges historical approaches to realist and modern art to explore the nature vs culture divide through figures that examine various overlapping themes of anthropocenterism using natural and man made elements and materials.\nTed's work has exhibited in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Steamwhistle Gallery, the RMG, The Station Gallery, Nathan Phillips Square, Bluffs Gallery, the Super Wonder Gallery and his Sculptural Mural Installation is the centerpiece installation of the Aurora Cultural Centre in Aurora Ontario.\n\nIn paint I work with Aerosol and acrylic and Latex. In Sculpture I work in clays, fibreglass, resins, bronze and wood and am now experimenting with 3D printed pieces. I would like to work with StART to develop more street art that challenges the urban landscape with art based on nature and animals. My practice is moving more to the 3D side of things and I would like to work with StART to fabricate more street level sculptural pieces as I see the need for that in Toronto.\nI have mentored many emerging artists but I feel I could use help in taking my own practice to the next level possibly through mentor ship or guidance from another artist.\nI also coordinate creative projects and have worked previously with StART on the Outside the Box Program, with the Bell Box Murals Project and with the Aurora Cultural Centre facilitating workshops, designing and creating artwork and mentoring emerging artists.",

I believe we all must do our part and I wanted to showcase how all of us our connected. I have included some of my Anishnawbe teachings about the 6 nations, the 4 directions and multiple layers of the medicine wheel to further showcase connection. This mural has four characters with the medicine wheel of the Anishnawbe people symbolized in each character. These symbols and characters represent all of humanity. It also includes the animal, plants, insects, humans, fish, and birds, and sacred geometry patterns within a variety of colours and shapes. My objective was to create both a tribute mural and a visual healing piece at the same time. This artwork is dedicated to all the Front line workers from an Anishnawbe artist perspective. I am deeply grateful to them, and have used this opportunity to say Thank you, 'Chi Miigwetch', with my own personal touch.",
