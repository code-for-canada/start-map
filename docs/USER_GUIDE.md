# StART Digital: User Guide

## Adding/Removing Images from Map

1. Open the Airtable Base to [its "info" table][airtable].
1. Find the record you wish to modify images for.
1. Click an element in the row of interest, and then hit "spacebar" to open the expanded view.
1. At the bottom, modify the "images" field, either adding, deleting, or dragging images to change the order.
	- When adding new images, make sure that the maximum dimension (height or width) is 800 pixels. (Larger images are a waste of space and bandwidth, and will result in reduced performance.) 
	- Here's an easy tool for resizing images: https://bulkresizephotos.com/en?resize_type=absolute&resize_value=800&skip_resize_settings=true
  - The top-left image will be the cover image or the artwork, and the rest will be in order.
1. Any changes you make will be reflected on the staging site within an hour.
1. Once you've confirmed that the images are displaying correctly on the staging site, tell Gabe and he'll update the public ("production") website.
